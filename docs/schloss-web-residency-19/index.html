    <h1>
      Frog Chorus : Algorithms Made Audible
    </h1>
    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>In 1982, the Dutch physicist and sound artist, Felix Hess, began producing sound installations based on frogs, whose entrancing song he first encountered in the hillsides of Adelaide. On returning to the Netherlands, he began developing robotic frogs, each outfitted with a microphone, speaker, and circuitry, enabling them to listen for and recognize each other to produce choruses like those he first heard in Australia.</p>
<p>The project I propose is to translate Felix‚Äôs original work with frog-robots into a web-app, allowing a group of participants to summon their own frog chorus using their phones, the underlying algorithms for behavioral modeling and audio feature extraction made audible. In having each phone as a frog within the chorus, participants are invited to put their phones down and join in a performance of active listening as they walk around their phones as sound sculpture.</p>
<p>While remaining faithful to Felix‚Äôs original work, this project extends it with a critique of what it means to live in a world increasingly of machines talking to each other. In actuality, frogs behave through phonotaxis (the movement of an organism with respect to sound), which I take as a poetic metaphor for how we might navigate algorithmically-governed environments. In an age where machines more convincingly give an impression of aliveness, the simple act of listening may serve as an act of resistance, a place from which to understand how our own aliveness is not like that of a machine.</p>

    <h2>Project Format</h2>
      <p>
        I wish to present this project in two main parts: (1) a web-app, which may be self-hosted or embedded onto an Akademie Solitude webpage; and (2) an essay, which contextualizes and historicizes the project. Additionally, I will be living in Berlin in August and September of this year, and would enjoy the option of leading performances in Germany using this project.
      </p>
    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York) is an interdisciplinary technologist who makes <a href="/#software">software</a>, <a href="/#sound">sound</a>, and <a href="/#ceramics">ceramics</a>. Across these different media, he approaches his work as sculpture, as an engagement with some form of materiality that is ultimately rooted in embodied experience.</p>
<p>As a full-stack software developer, he has worked primarily at media companies (<em>Vox</em> and <em>New York Magazine</em>) building out the sites like <em><a href="https://nymag.com/strategist">The Strategist</a></em>, but began his programming career within institutions of academic research science. He considers sound art to be his primary creative practice, and has mostly been working in a supporting/collaborative role with artists like Eli Keszler and James Hoff for institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the London ICA. Since 2019, his interest in surface and form has also led to ceramics, which he likes to think of as sound made out of clay.</p>
<p>He is currently taking a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù while surveying the current techno-social landscape and searching for the appropriate containers for his upcoming professional and creative projects.</p>
