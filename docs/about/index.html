        <p class="project-grid-item-4">I’m a software engineer and artist based in New York City, with a multi-disciplinary background in research science and humanities.
<br>
<br>
When I was younger, I wanted to be a filmmaker, or a furniture designer, or a concert guitarist. While my fantasies of <em>becoming</em> have shifted over the years, I still feel drawn to certain kinds of objects and forms of aesthetic experience. Over the last decade, my energies have settled, through desire paths and streams, into software, sound, and ceramics.</p>

</figure>
<p class="project-grid-item-full">I’m interested in the interplay of phenomonologically irreducible elements of surface and structure, of object and affect, of screen and software. I think of my methodology as broadly sculptural, in which form and content are not determined <em>a priori</em>, and the final work emerges in negotation with the materiality and poetics of the medium.

<!-- The British psychoanalyst Christopher Bollas writes that "the aesthetic moment is a caesura in time when the subject feels held in symmetry and solitude by the spirit of the object" [1]. In our daily lives, these moments of transformative _caesura_ come unbeckoned, or not at all, and a life well-lived might be one in which the possibility of such moments feel close at hand. -->

<!-- As a product-driven technologist, I'm broadly interested in the synthesis of technical affordances with human needs and desires. I approach software design and org charts as technologies for managing complexity, and believe that "perfect systems" exists only in their allure ... when you're holding a hammer, everything becomes a nail.

<!-- Work with sound forms the basis of my creative practice, which has evolved through engagement with materiality and metaphor. In recent work, like [Airports for Music](/projects/airports-for-music) and [Frog Chorus](/projects/frog-chorus), frogs and microphones act as metaphors on the act of listening itself, in both the compositional process and in prompting audiences to attend to their own act of listening. In addition to my solo practice, my sound-based work also includes assisting artists like [Eli Keszler](https://www.elikeszler.com/), [James Hoff](https://www.james-hoff.com/), and [Glenn Jones](https://thrilljockey.com/artists/glenn-jones) on installations, performances, and recordings, for institutions and labels like the Whitney Museum of American Art, PAN, and Thrill Jockey. -->

<!-- In my web-based practice, I'm interested in ways in which [interfaces construct users](https://academic.oup.com/mit-press-scholarship-online/book/23681/chapter-abstract/184886856?redirectedFrom=fulltext&login=false), and I've developed a number of personal projects that experiment with user interfaces as strategies for using technology in more expansive ways: [the phone as a frog](https://frogchor.us), [AI as an interface to an archive](/midi-archive), and [weaving music](/weaving). Just as poetry may undo the instrumentalization of language [2], poetic interfaces may allow us to move beyond software that is merely instrumental and instrumentalizing. -->

<!-- My web-based projects have been a means for exploring the use of technology to augment the senses, a map to a real, or surreal, territory. This is most apparent in _Frog Chorus_, where a chorus of frogs emerges from smartphones, becoming an audible environment that reorients the user towards an expansive act of listening. -->
<!-- In addition to his solo sound practice, he has also collaborated with artists like Eli Keszler and James Hoff for institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and Eyebeam. Over the last five years, he has extended his interest in the materiality of sound into a material exploration of surface and form in ceramics. -->
<!-- Reuben Son makes software, sound, and ceramics. For more than a decade, his sound-based work has engaged the materiality of sound, in the form of magnetic tape or through metaphors of textile weaving and fragrance. In recent work, he has focused on the act of listening itself, both in the compositional process, and in prompting audiences to attend to their own act of listening. This emphasis on embodied experience and materiality also forms the root of his ceramics practice, and he is currently developing a new body of work that combines sound with ceramics. -->

<!-- The projects below represent an incomplete index of my creative work between the period of 2009 to the present. I'm still figuring things out, but I'm happy you're here and I hope you enjoy browsing some of the things I've made along the way. While none of these projects are truly _finished_, I do feel like this body of work has connecting throughlines, and has given me the space to think and to feel ... and if not to find answers, to at least ask better questions.

<!-- I have found that the locus of vitality exists in material engagement with the world, within only a loose framework of epistemology, a minimum viable ontology.
