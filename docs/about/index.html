  <!-- I make software, sound, and ceramics.  -->
<p>I’m a Korean-American artist and technologist based in New York City, working primarily with software, sound, and ceramics. My current practice centers on the poetics of air: as environment made audible, as a force upon language, and in the sonorous potentiality of ceramic vessels. Air is both material and metaphor; like meaning itself, it cannot exist in a vacuum. To pay attention to the air is to attend to the liminal, the relational, and the dynamic.</p>
<p>My work is rooted in a background in sound art, and in particular the act of listening itself as a generative space for aesthetic experience. I’ve been developing work around this through what I call “choreographies of listening.” In “After Orpheus” (2025), the exhibition visitor interacts with the sculpture by holding a paper cup. In the “Airs” (2025) poems, the reader moves the collection like the blowing wind.</p>
<p>Expanding this body of work, I’m currently developing a series of ceramic sculptures and text-based scores that activate the air through listening.</p>

<!-- When I was younger, I wanted to be a filmmaker, or a furniture designer, or a concert guitarist. While my fantasies of _becoming_ have shifted over the years, I still feel drawn to certain kinds of objects and forms of aesthetic experience. Over the last decade, my energies have settled, through desire paths and streams, into software, sound, and ceramics. -->

<!-- The British psychoanalyst Christopher Bollas writes that "the aesthetic moment is a caesura in time when the subject feels held in symmetry and solitude by the spirit of the object" [1]. In our daily lives, these moments of transformative _caesura_ come unbeckoned, or not at all, and a life well-lived might be one in which the possibility of such moments feel close at hand. -->

<!-- Work with sound forms the basis of my creative practice, which has evolved through engagement with materiality and metaphor. In recent work, like [Airports for Music](/projects/airports-for-music) and [Frog Chorus](/projects/frog-chorus), frogs and microphones act as metaphors on the act of listening itself, in both the compositional process and in prompting audiences to attend to their own act of listening. In addition to my solo practice, my sound-based work also includes assisting artists like [Eli Keszler](https://www.elikeszler.com/), [James Hoff](https://www.james-hoff.com/), and [Glenn Jones](https://thrilljockey.com/artists/glenn-jones) on installations, performances, and recordings, for institutions and labels like the Whitney Museum of American Art, PAN, and Thrill Jockey. -->

<!-- Reuben Son makes software, sound, and ceramics. For more than a decade, his sound-based work has engaged the materiality of sound, in the form of magnetic tape or through metaphors of textile weaving and fragrance. In recent work, he has focused on the act of listening itself, both in the compositional process, and in prompting audiences to attend to their own act of listening. This emphasis on embodied experience and materiality also forms the root of his ceramics practice, and he is currently developing a new body of work that combines sound with ceramics. -->
