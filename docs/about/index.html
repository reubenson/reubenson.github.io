  <p>I’m a Korean-American artist and technologist based in New York City, working primarily with software, sound, and ceramics. My recent and ongoing body of work engages what I call “<strong>choreographies of listening</strong>”, in which the act of listening situates the body to both the artwork and the larger environment.</p>
<p>For both my ceramic and software-based works, this emphasis on listening manifests a somatic consideration of materiality and phenomenology beyond traditional qualities of surface and form. In “<a href="/works/after-orpheus"><em>After Orpheus</em></a>” (2025), the exhibition visitor interacts with a sound sculpture both through the reverberations emanating from the ceramic bell, and transduced through a paper cup that is held against the vibrating piano wire. The poetry-sound collection “<a href="/works/airs"><em>Airs</em></a>” (2025), emerged from my private practice of plein air listening and uses text and sound together to structure an experience of the moving air as a force upon both language and sound. And in the software-performance “<a href="/works/frog-chorus"><em>Frog Chorus</em></a>” (2023), smartphones generate an interactive sound installation that folds machine listening into a choreography of listening.</p>
<p>Across disparate media, my aims tend towards prioritizing the poetics of contingency, whereby works cannot be reduced to exercises in abstraction or conceptualism. While my works are often motivated by research into the art and science of consciousness, my studio practice is essentially an experimental one, through which an originating idea or spark may eventually find its form.</p>
<!-- I'm a Korean-American artist and technologist based in New York City, working primarily with software, sound, and ceramics. My recent and ongoing body of work engages what I call "choreographies of listening", in which the act of listening situates the body within the larger environment of the sculptural artwork. For both my ceramics- and software-based works, this emphasis on listening introduces a somatic consideration of materiality and phenomenology beyond traditional qualities of surface and form. 
<p>In “After Orpheus” (2025), the exhibition visitor interacts with a sound sculpture first through its reverberations in the air, and then through a paper cup held against its vibrating steel wire. The poetry-sound collection “Airs” (2025), emerged from my private practice of plein air listening and uses text and sound together to structure an experience of the moving air as a force upon both language and sound. And in the software “Frog Chorus”, smartphones generate an interactive sound installation that positions the human act of listening itself alongside that of the machine.</p>
<p>My working methods across various media are unified in prioritizing the poetics of contingency, whereby works cannot be reduced to the conceptual or exercises in abstraction. While my works are often motivated by my readings in poetry, psychoanalysis, and the history of science, my studio practice is essentially an experimental one, through which an originating idea or spark must eventually find its form. --&gt;</p>

* choreographies of listening, is a phrase that already existed but i think i also did come up with. it captures more than what i'd been saying before abnter-media out composing listening.
* poetics of air, or of contingency feels loose and abstract still, perhaps taking too much liberty.

<!-- I'm a Korean-American artist and technologist based in New York City, working primarily with software, sound, and ceramics. My current practice centers on the poetics of air: as environment made audible, as a force upon language, and in the sonorous potentiality of ceramic vessels. Air is both material and metaphor; like meaning itself, it cannot exist in a vacuum. To pay attention to the air is to attend to the liminal, the relational, and the dynamic.

My work is rooted in a background in sound art, and in particular the act of listening itself as a generative space for aesthetic experience. I've been developing work around this through what I call "choreographies of listening." In "After Orpheus" (2025), the exhibition visitor interacts with the sculpture by holding a paper cup. In the "Airs" (2025) poems, the reader moves the collection like the blowing wind. 

Expanding this body of work, I'm currently developing a series of ceramic sculptures and text-based scores that activate the air through listening. -->
<!-- further explore exchanges between object and affect. I believe that the aesthetic experience is irreducible to the object, and the act of multi-attentional listening can be used towards creative and liberatory ends more broadly. -->
<!-- Reuben Son (lives in New York City) is a Korean-American artist who primarily makes software, ceramics, and sound.

<!-- He is a longtime collaborator with Eli Keszler, whom he has worked with on installations, performances, and recordings since 2011. -->
<!-- As an artist, his work deals with the _air_ as both material and metaphor, explores the sculptural interplay between surface and structure, and examines the exchanges between object and affect. -->

In recent work, he has focused on the act of listening itself, both in the compositional process, and in prompting audiences to attend to their own act of listening. This emphasis on embodied experience and materiality also forms the root of his ceramics practice, and he is currently developing a new body of work that combines sound with ceramics. -->
