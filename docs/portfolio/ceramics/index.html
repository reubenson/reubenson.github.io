    These photos document some of the pieces I designed and fabricated during a two-week workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at The Haystack Mountain School of Crafts. In this work, I focused on site-specificity and expression of the line, which are atypical for ceramic sculpture, and wrote a brief essay about my process(<a href="https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd">https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd</a>)

  <figcaption>These vessels are from an ongoing series of "casa mugs", produced through carving into the clay to produce the vessel and handle. The exterior surface is untouched by any direct surface intervention, as I intended to have the surface preserve the imprints and indentations from contact with the plastic bag the clay arrived in.</figcaption>

    These vessels are of an intimate scale, no taller than 2", and allow for expressions of form, rhythm, and surface that may get lost in ceramics of standard scale.

  <figcaption>
    My ceramics practice is roughly split between wheel-thrown and hand-built work, with the later especially conducive to generating more intuitive and organic forms. In general, the act of "thinking with my hands" and the priviliging of embodied cognition are central to my ceramics practice.

    These udus (clay drums) are some of the prototypes I've developed as part of a new body of work around sonically-focused ceramics. Although traditional udu vessels are formed through coil-building, I produce mine in the Korean tradition of moon jars, in which two wheel-thrown bowls are slipped, scored, and joined at the midsection.
