    In the summer of 2023, I attended a workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at <em>The Haystack Mountain School of Crafts</em>. These photos document the pieces I designed and fabricated during that time, in which I focused on two atypical qualities for ceramic sculpture: the line and site-specificity. I wrote about my experience at <a href="https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd">https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd</a>

    These small format vessels are no taller than 2", and provide me with room to quickly test and explore variations in form, rhythm, and surface.

  <figcaption>
    My ceramics practice is roughly split between wheel-thrown and hand-built work, with the later especially conducive to generating more intuitive and organic forms. In general, the act of "thinking with my hands" and the priviliging of embodied cognition are central to my ceramics practice.

    These udus (clay drums) are part of an ongoing set of prototypes I've been developing as part of a new body of work around sonically-focused ceramics. Although traditional udu vessels are formed through coil-building, I produce mine in the Korean tradition of moon jars, in which two wheel-thrown bowls are slipped, scored, and joined at the midsection.
