<!-- Prototype for the presentation of prose poetry on the page with a combination of visual manipulation, coloration, and animation.

The text for these poems come from research into the history of auras and fingerprinting. Using the [FingerprintJS](https://fingerprint.com/blog/browser-fingerprinting-techniques/) NPM library, the animation and coloration will be rendered differently across different browser profiles (not limited to user agent).

Approximately twenty of these poems will be presented in total, which readers can click through on mobile & desktop devices.


~~A proposal for a visual-text piece around the theme of the digital fingerprint.~~

~~As implemented by libraries like [FingerprintJS](https://fingerprint.com/blog/browser-fingerprinting-techniques/), websites can uniquely identify users based on a collection of machine-specific attributes that by themselves are insignificant but in aggregate are unlikely to be repeated across individuals.~~

~~My initial idea was to translate the visitor's digital fingerprint into a subtly animating color-field <em>aura</em>, which would appear differently for each visitor. Prose would be rendered alongside this aura, or alternatively, I was also thinking of presenting concrete poems, inspired by Dom Sylvestre Houedard ([example](https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/wp-cms/uploads/2017/05/7-the-benedictine-monk-who-connected-concrete-poetry-1.jpg)).~~

~~I started tinkering with ways of animating the aura, to give it a more organic sense of texture, and to see what sort of text this might inspire me to write. But I got carried away with the animation and it became more like experimental film of the mid-twentieth century. So now I'm wondering whether a prose "film" might be closer to the format I'm interested in presenting, with the text appearing almost like subtitles.~~

~~I think there's a few different directions this project might go, but the content would ultimately be a sort of meditation on the connection between digital fingerprint and aura. And while I think it would be educational to address surveillance technology, I plan to focus the overall tone towards something that feels numinous, as opposed to didactic.~~

<!-- SVG filter seems like a good way of customizing the aura to a specific color palette without having to write explicit pixel logic -->
