As an interactive sound sculpture, it brought exhibition visitors into intimate modes of listening (without speakers) and expressed the inherent sonic potential of the ceramic vessel.</p>

<!-- My intention is to expand this general methodology into a body of work that further explores the use of non-traditional materials to activate the air within ceramic forms. -->
<p class="project-grid-item-3">The wheelthrown ceramic bell add physical tension required for the piano wire, while also acoustically amplifying its vibrations. The form of the ceramic vessel influences its acoustics greatly, and my intention is explore a large variety of forms as I extend this sculpture into a larger body of work.
<br>
<br>
Throughout the residency at EKWC, I would use a combination of traditional techniques and 3D printing of molds to develop a collection of forms that would work together as an ensemble of sound sculptures. Although <em>After Orpheus</em> was presented as a single sculpture, my intention is to present these sculptures as a room-scale installation of many pieces with different voicings, inflected through the physics of form. The Soundlab at EKWC would be especially helpful for analysing the acoustics of vessels and guiding formal experimentation over the residency period.</p>
<!-- I would use the 3D mold-making capacities at EKWC extensively for creating complex or modular forms, and the Soundlab at EKWC would be especially helpful for analysing the acoustics of vessels and guiding experimentation over the residency. -->
<!-- The original form I've produced is bell-shaped, which was conceptually motivated by the idea of the horn of an instrument, but forms that are more closed would produce more interesting interactions between the piano wire and the ceramics.  -->
<!-- This sculpture is part of a body of work (in progress) in which ceramic vessels are activated through a variety of physical means. Although this sculpture could be also placed outdoors and activated by the wind, here the indoor installation relies instead on electromagnetic activation (via e-bow).
\
\
The sculpture takes inspiration from the long tradition of aeolian instruments activated by the wind and the myth of Orpheus's lyre, said to have moved stones.

<!-- A pile of bricks, a ceramic bell, and a c-stand frame the physical tension of a long steel wire that quietly sings. With a cup held up against the wire, you can almost hear a willing of stones to dance once more, the ghost of the lyre of Orpheus. -->

<p class="project-grid-item-3">As a sound artist and ceramist, I’m interested in materiality of both earth and air. In working towards installation-scale, I use silences and resonances inherent to ceramic vessels in order to draw attention beyond visual forms. One of my strongest influences in thinking about materiality and space is the Dutch sound artist Felix Hess, who has inspired my previous work. Like Felix, I tend to view art-making as an endeavor to expand the senses and create spaces for heightened sensitivity and open-ended aesthetic experience.</p>
<!-- I'm interested in adding an additional sensory dimension to the traditional silences of ceramic vessels, and expanding the scale

I have practiced ceramics for six years, but my creative practice is grounded in sound art, and one of my guiding aims in ceramics is to explore the various forms of silence and resonance inherent to ceramic vessels. One of my strongest influences in thinking about sound and space is the Dutch sound artist Felix Hess, who has inspired previous works I've made. Like Felix, I am interested in creating multi-sensory installation-scale work that -->
<!-- Felix's practice was centered around creating installations and situations in which the audience could become more sensitive to the environment, -->
<!-- [insert felix hess quote] -->
<!-- I would not intend to use my time at EKWC to develop all the sculptures necessary for an upcoming exhibition, and instead would plan to develop a library of CAD files for mold-making that would be used for production at a later time and subject to ongoing research and experimentation. -->
