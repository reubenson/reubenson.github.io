<!-- _Meander_ was produced with 3D-printed porcelain, using the linear modality of this technology to **blur the line** between ornament and form. Conventional ceramic vessels have a well-defined interior and exterior, most legibly so in the thin line of the lip, and ornamentation is constrained to the exterior. In _Meander_, the classic Greek key motif interpenetrates both surface and form, using the continuous line of the 3D-printer to create a convoluted structure that requires tracing by eye to distinguish what is interior or exterior to the vessel. This work also appears in the July/August 2024 issue of [Ceramic Review](https://www.ceramicreview.com/issues/ceramic-review-issue-328/).

<!-- using the specific means of this technology to frame the evolution of the line in arts and architecture. Taking advantage of the fact that 3D-printing can make a single continuous line of clay, I used the Greek meander motif to transform the ornamental line into architectural forms. -->
<!-- Over the course of a two-week workshop at The Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, I designed, fabricated, and activated various ceramics sculptures. In this work, I focused on site-specificity and expression of the line, and [wrote a brief essay about my process](https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd).

<!-- As the centerpiece piece in my final show, I assembled a mixed-media sculpture that included porcelain (both bisque and greenware), wood boards, a rock, a piece of seaweed, a barnacle shell, and a stencil-print made of porcelain dust. The resulting sculpture plays with the idea of a print (in its different contexts) and gestures at notions of land art (Robert Smithson’s Spiral Jetty, porcelain as earthen material), which came full circle when I brought the brittle, unfired ceramic sculpture (what we call greenware) to dissolve into the ocean the hour before finally departing from campus.

<!-- As I continued to work with/against/through these printers, I came back around to the core, unresolvable question of what exactly these machines were freeing up our hands to do, aside from signing the work, or a bit of touch-up. While I did find myself missing the tactile feedback of building up forms by hand, I did also find myself being less precious about each printed object, that while each object had been de-virtualized as a result of the printing process, its physical existence seemed somehow still tenuous, and in flux. -->
