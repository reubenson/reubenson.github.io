      <h1>Weaving Music</h1>
<h2>An algorithmic music sequencer</h2>
<p><strong><a href="/weaving">Weaving Music</a></strong> is a web-app that uses weaving diagrams as the basis for creating musical patterns. I began writing this software during a <a href="https://elektronmusikstudion.se/composers/2019/1013-reuben-son-ems-10-19-june-2019">residency at EMS</a> (Stockholm), to generate multi-voice musical sequences and rhythms that could be played via MIDI through the Buchla and Serge synthesizers at their studios.</p>
