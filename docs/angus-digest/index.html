      <h1>Chrome Extension for Angus</h1>
<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p><a href="/extensions/extension_v0_2.zip">version 0.2 download</a> [12.18.2023]</p>
<ul>
<li>This version runs through the three &quot;Large Area&quot; options listed by SearchTempest in the &quot;Group Links By&quot; filter
<a href="/extensions/extension_v0_1.zip">version 0.1 download</a> [12.12.2023]</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download the bundled source code for this extension above and unzip it. You'll probably want to save it to your Documents folder, or wherever is easy to keep track of it.</li>
<li>Follow <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked">Google's instructions here on how to &quot;Load an unpacked extension&quot;</a>, using the directory containing the source code from the previous step. If you have already installed a previous version of the extension, you'll want to remove the old version, and &quot;load an unpacked extension&quot; again with the new version.</li>
<li>Now that the extension is installed, you can pin it to your extensions bar. The extension is currently represented by a small motorcycle-emoji (üèç) icon.</li>
<li>Note: you currently have to click the extension twice to activate it, hopefully a small bug I can resolve in the next round.</li>
</ul>
