      <h3>Simone Weil, <em>Gravity and Grace</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;In general we must not wish for the disappearance of any of our troubles, but grace to transform them&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;He who has not been able to become nothing runs the risk of reacing a moment when everything other than himself ceases to exist&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Capitalism has brought about the emancipation of collective humanity with respect to nature. But this collective humanity has itself taken on with respect to the individual the oppressive function formerly exercise by nature&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You could not be born at a better period than the present, when we have lost everything&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;To work in order to eat, to eat in order to work. If we regard one of the end as an end, or taken separately, we are lost. Only the cycle contains the truth&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Iain McGilchrist, <em>The Master and His Emissary</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Rejection of the body, and of embodied existence, naturally facilitates the application of general rules [...] abstraction facilitates generalisation&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The loss of metaphor is a loss of cognitive content. Thinking cannot be severed from our bodily existence, out of which all metaphors arise&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;[...] through imagination the fragmentary impression, one becomes in part the creator of what one perceives&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;... in and through poetry, which with its reliance on metaphor and implicit meaning allows the right hemisphere to circumvent ordinary porceses of everyday language, which inevitably return us to the familiar, and reduce the uminous to the quotidian&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Both scientific materialism and the dialectical materialism of Engels and Marx emerged from the view that science was the only authority&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;... innate structures of the left hemisphere are, through technology, being incarnated in the world it has come to dominate&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;the nature of attention alters what it finds; and specifically that when we cease to act, to be involved, spontaneous, and intutive, and instead become passive, disengaged, self-conscious ... it becomes bizarre, alien ...&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Devitalisation leads to boredom, and boredom in turn, to sensationalism&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;In terms of hemispheres, the right is more sensitive to harmony ... an analogue of perspective in painting&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;... bureaucracy would be both a product of the left hemisphere and a reinforcement of it in the external world&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;One possibility is that music, which brought us together before language, might even prove effective in regenerating commonality, avoiding the need for words that have been devalued, or for which we have become too cynical. Let's not forget that it was with music that Orpheus once moved stones&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Certainty is the greatest of all illusions: whatever kind of fundamentalism it may underwrite ... it is what the ancients meant by hubris&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jamieson Webster, <em>Disorganisation &amp; Sex</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;... if the personality is a symptom, defensively structured like armour that the subject carries around, this armour has significance ... The armour is actually an armourial, a coat of arms, with traces of a subject's history and pre-history, namely what the subject inherits&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Action, when based in anxiety, is reduced to controlling the appearance of this Otherness, either in oneself or the other person&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The drift of panic and anxiety puts us into the drift of lanugage, which is always where poetry and humour find their home, or rather, their homelessness&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adam Phillips, <em>Wanting to Change</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>&quot;For both Freud and James, the enemy of pleasure and growth was stuckness, addiction, fixity, stasis. They teach us about the temptations of stultification, of the allure of inertia ... of the wish to attack our own development&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;... conversion tends to be a cure for skepticism; a narrowing of the mind that frees the mind. Frees it, one might say, from complexity&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;... we think of language as daemonic. We think of ourselves as doing things with words, while language does things to us&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Because, in Freud's view, desire is always in excess of he object's ability to satisfy, desire enlivens us by endangering us&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;In one tradition of psychoanalysis, so-called sexual perversions are considered to be an individual's self-cure for traumas of early maternal care&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Conversion here doesn't merely replace one reality with another; it redeems an existing reality: conversion as psychic alchemy. Conversion turns up when something deemed to be unmodificable and intolerable has to be transformed&quot;</li>
</ul>
