        <h3>Simone Weil, <em>Gravity and Grace</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“In general we must not wish for the disappearance of any of our troubles, but grace to transform them”</li>
<li>“He who has not been able to become nothing runs the risk of reacing a moment when everything other than himself ceases to exist”</li>
<li>“Capitalism has brought about the emancipation of collective humanity with respect to nature. But this collective humanity has itself taken on with respect to the individual the oppressive function formerly exercise by nature”</li>
<li>“You could not be born at a better period than the present, when we have lost everything”</li>
<li>“To work in order to eat, to eat in order to work. If we regard one of the end as an end, or taken separately, we are lost. Only the cycle contains the truth”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Iain McGilchrist, <em>The Master and His Emissary</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“Rejection of the body, and of embodied existence, naturally facilitates the application of general rules […] abstraction facilitates generalisation”</li>
<li>“The loss of metaphor is a loss of cognitive content. Thinking cannot be severed from our bodily existence, out of which all metaphors arise”</li>
<li>“[…] through imagination the fragmentary impression, one becomes in part the creator of what one perceives”</li>
<li>“… in and through poetry, which with its reliance on metaphor and implicit meaning allows the right hemisphere to circumvent ordinary porceses of everyday language, which inevitably return us to the familiar, and reduce the uminous to the quotidian”</li>
<li>“Both scientific materialism and the dialectical materialism of Engels and Marx emerged from the view that science was the only authority”</li>
<li>“… innate structures of the left hemisphere are, through technology, being incarnated in the world it has come to dominate”</li>
<li>“the nature of attention alters what it finds; and specifically that when we cease to act, to be involved, spontaneous, and intutive, and instead become passive, disengaged, self-conscious … it becomes bizarre, alien …”</li>
<li>“Devitalisation leads to boredom, and boredom in turn, to sensationalism”</li>
<li>“In terms of hemispheres, the right is more sensitive to harmony … an analogue of perspective in painting”</li>
<li>“… bureaucracy would be both a product of the left hemisphere and a reinforcement of it in the external world”</li>
<li>“One possibility is that music, which brought us together before language, might even prove effective in regenerating commonality, avoiding the need for words that have been devalued, or for which we have become too cynical. Let’s not forget that it was with music that Orpheus once moved stones”</li>
<li>“Certainty is the greatest of all illusions: whatever kind of fundamentalism it may underwrite … it is what the ancients meant by hubris”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Jamieson Webster, <em>Disorganisation &amp; Sex</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“… if the personality is a symptom, defensively structured like armour that the subject carries around, this armour has significance … The armour is actually an armourial, a coat of arms, with traces of a subject’s history and pre-history, namely what the subject inherits”</li>
<li>“Action, when based in anxiety, is reduced to controlling the appearance of this Otherness, either in oneself or the other person”</li>
<li>“The drift of panic and anxiety puts us into the drift of lanugage, which is always where poetry and humour find their home, or rather, their homelessness”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adam Phillips, <em>Wanting to Change</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“For both Freud and James, the enemy of pleasure and growth was stuckness, addiction, fixity, stasis. They teach us about the temptations of stultification, of the allure of inertia … of the wish to attack our own development”</li>
<li>“… conversion tends to be a cure for skepticism; a narrowing of the mind that frees the mind. Frees it, one might say, from complexity”</li>
<li>“… we think of language as daemonic. We think of ourselves as doing things with words, while language does things to us”</li>
<li>“Because, in Freud’s view, desire is always in excess of he object’s ability to satisfy, desire enlivens us by endangering us”</li>
<li>“In one tradition of psychoanalysis, so-called sexual perversions are considered to be an individual’s self-cure for traumas of early maternal care”</li>
<li>“Conversion here doesn’t merely replace one reality with another; it redeems an existing reality: conversion as psychic alchemy. Conversion turns up when something deemed to be unmodificable and intolerable has to be transformed”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Adam Phillips, <em>On Getting Better</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“When getting better doesn’t only mean getting safer, it means being able to risk feeling more alive, to risk taking risks, to risk learning and not learning from experience …”</li>
<li>“Why does the ego, bureaucratically, have to enlarge its ‘organisation’ in order to free itself?”</li>
<li>“[…] we have always been curing ourselves, and that what we suffer from are our self-cures, which are called symptoms.”</li>
<li>“I believe cure at its root means care. About 1700 it started to degenerate into a name for medical treatment.”</li>
<li>“When it comes to pleasure and satisfaction we are prone to take the path of least resistance; we are prone to getting it wrong.”</li>
<li>“We have to consider the possibility that a society obsessed by satisfaction may be very unsatisfied, may even have the wrong ideas about what satisfaction might be.”</li>
<li>“We may be at our most omniscent in our assumptions about pleasure and satisfaction; and we are at our most omniscent when we are most fearful of our curiosity.”</li>
<li>“Sexuality, Freud discovers - whatever else it is - is a way of talking about what people want from each other.”</li>
<li>“[…] truths are illusions we have forgotten are illusions; they are metaphors which have become habitual, and drained of sensory force”</li>
<li>“It is the wish that takes us from the past into possible futures.”</li>
<li>“[…] that so-called methods for the pursuit of truth - of something called truth in religion, or philosophy, or science - could be merely a form of over-simplification, as though truth as an object of desire is akin to what psychoanalysis describes as a sexual perversion or a fetish, construed to narrow the mind and coerce feeling.”</li>
<li>“If the precondition for a concept of truth is the use of language, then language can mislead us with its truth.”</li>
<li>“Wishing is a problem because of its intrinsic omniscience.”</li>
<li>“People trapped in a vocabulary need to get out more.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Carl Jung, <em>Memories, Dreams, Reflections</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“We rush impetuously into novelty, driven by a mounting sense of insufficiency, dissatisfaction, and restlessness.  We no longer live on what we have, but on promises…We refuse to recognize that everything better is purchased at the price of something worse.…new methods or gadgets, are of course impressive at first, but in the long run they are dubious and…dearly paid for.  They, by no means, increase the contentment or happiness of people on the whole.  Mostly they are deceptive sweetenings of existence, like speedier communications which unpleasantly accelerate the tempo of life and leave us with less time than ever before.” <a href="https://reinventinghome.org/the-house-as-mirror-of-the-psyche/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20rush%20impetuously,MDR%2C%20p%20236">(MDR, p 236)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>D.W. Winnicott, <em>Reality and Playing</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“The finished creation never heals the underlying lack of sense of self.”</li>
<li>“Compliance carries with it a sense of futility for the individual and is associated with the idea that nothing matters and life is not worth living.”</li>
<li>“We do not need to think that human nature has altered. What we need to do is look for the everlasting in the ephemeral.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Michael Hamel, <em>Through Music to the Self</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“But do we listen to music? Hardly ever. Yet away it plays …”</li>
<li>“Our ear is impaired; the noise of our environment renders our ears dull and insensitive […] Our listening capacity is conditioned.”</li>
<li>“[…] most music reflects and bolsters up the state of its clientele, their inner chaos, their private insecurity and lonelines”</li>
<li>“On meeting a stranger it is immediately possible to detect both personality and level of consciousness by the sound of the voice.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ian Penman, <em>Thousands of Mirrors</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“There may have been a post-economic miracle but it was bought with the lives and souls of many unwitting victims. At the expense of basic humanity: a dreaming, desiring, demanding humanity.”</li>
<li>“A troubling feeling of not being entirely at home in the body. Unmoored, adrift, a feather of an image.”</li>
<li>“What sticks in the memory are small sounds, looks, gestures.”</li>
<li>“I remember waking at a certain point and feeling as if the four walls of books around me were like my very own Egyptian tomb; that I was, in a sense, already dead. So many collected and archived things snug in their designated places. Not so much a space for dreaming or reverie, as one limned by regret, curdled concupiscence, and increasingly, Niagras of sudden unexpected tears. A librarian of my own timidity, withdrawal, and discontent”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Christopher Bollas, <em>The Shadow of the Object</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“In adult life, the quest is not to possess the object; rather the object is pursued in order to surrender to it as a medium that alters the self, where the subject-as-supplicant now feels himself to be the recipient of enviro-somatic caring, identified with metamorphoses of the self.”</li>
<li>“The aesthetic moment is a caesura in time when the subject feels held in symmetry and solitude by the spirit of the object.”</li>
<li>“The transformational object seems to promise the beseeching subject an experience where self fragmentations will be integrated through a processing form.”</li>
<li>“Transformational-object-seeking is an endless memorial search for something in the future that resides in the past”</li>
<li>“[…] there is no adult who, in relation to himself as an object, is not existentially through self management, or representationally through self objectification, managing certain aspects of himself as a mother or father does a child.”</li>
<li>“As it is, this relation to himself as an object re-creates his mother’s own narcissistic uses of him, which he found quite pleasurable in many ways, and it biases his own way of handling himself as an object in his life.”</li>
<li>“In a generative mood the person goes into himself to contact the cute, unknown child self and thus has a greater chance of genreating some knowing of what has been part of the unthought known.”</li>
<li>“Moods are complex self states that may establish a mnemic environment in which the individual re-experiences and recreates former infant-child experiences and states of being.”</li>
<li>“Some people have annhiliated the creative element by developing an alternate mentality, one that aims to be objective, a mind that is characterized less by the psychic (by the representational symbolization of feelings, sensations and intersubjective perceptions) than by the objective. This mentality is not determined to represent the object, but to be the echo of thingness inherent in material objects, to be a commodity object in the world of human production.”</li>
<li>“To collect facts is ultimately to be identified with that which is collected: to be come a fact in one’s person.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Anders Frederick Steen, <em>Poetry is Growing in Our Garden</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“How can we change things that live within ourselves and let that become an example for others to follow? I don’t want to be part of this way of thinking, where ‘we know better’. I don’t want to be ‘against’, and I don’t want to be angry […] Instead, by following the change within myself I want to express the change I dream of other people making as well.”</li>
<li>“Move away from this conception of wine as art and craft, as a product of the soil, and see it instead as a piece of work that gives you direction and inspiration for understanding. Let wine be open rather than framed or defined; let it be a starting point for looking at the world differently – the world we’d like to create for others and ourselves. For me, it’s not necessarily a question of ‘knowing more’ or ‘knowing less’. It’s about the way we misunderstand wine (and many other things) once we force ourselves to undersstand it, force ourselves to find answers or integrate other people’s answers int our way of connecting with wine. This misunderstanding appears in our need to understand, categorise, and classify. Wine is meant to be felt by intuition, not reflection.”</li>
