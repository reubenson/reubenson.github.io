      <h2>Software</h2>
<p>As a software developer, his experience began when learning how to write code in various research science environments before working as a full-stack engineer and engineering manager at <a href="https://nymag.com"><em>New York Magazine</em></a>. The bulk of his tenure there was devoted to the development of <a href="https://nymag.com/strategist"><em>The Strategist</em></a>, with responsibilities spanning from implementing the full site redesign, and developing tools and services that power editorial, data, and business-development workflows in addition to the primary reader-experience across a number of distribution platforms (e.g. web, AMP, and Apple News).</p>
<p>He has also built out a number of projects for creative purposes. He developed custom software for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERbfczLUr-A"><em>Hobo UFO</em></a> project with artist James Hoff, which programmatically détourns Google Maps Street View into an audio-reactive cinematography reminiscent of Michael Snow’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYr_SvIKKuI"><em>La Région Centrale</em></a>.</p>
