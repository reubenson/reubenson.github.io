        <p>During a 10-day residency at Wave Farm, artists develop new transmission artworks, informed by access to a research library, equipment, unique workspace resources, and on-site staff support.</p>
<p>In 2024, the Wave Farm Residency Program will emphasize “Live Performance for an Expanded Studio Audience.” Each residency will conclude with a public event at Wave Farm, which is also a live radio broadcast on Wave Farm Radio: WGXC 90.7-FM Radio for Open Ears in NY’s Upper Hudson Valley.</p>

<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<!-- Please describe your current artistic practice in one or two succinct paragraphs. -->
<p>Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York City) is a Korean-American artist and technologist who makes sound, software, and ceramics. For more than a decade, his sound-based work has engaged the materiality of sound, as magnetic tape or through metaphors of woven textile and fragrance. In his most recent work, like <em><a href="/projects/airports-for-music">Airports For Music</a></em> (2023) and <em><a href="/projects/frog-chorus">Frog Chorus</a></em> (2023), he has focused on his practice around air as a critical medium for sound, what we give it (attention), and what it can carry (intention).</p>

<!-- Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York) is an interdisciplinary technologist who makes software, sound, and ceramics. Across these different media, he approaches his work as sculpture, as an engagement with some form of materiality that is ultimately rooted in embodied experience.

As a full-stack software developer, he has worked primarily at media companies (Vox and New York Magazine) building out the sites like The Strategist, but began his programming career within institutions of academic research science. He considers sound art to be his primary creative practice, and has mostly been working in a supporting/collaborative role with artists like Eli Keszler and James Hoff for institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the London ICA. Since 2019, his interest in surface and form has also led to ceramics, which he likes to think of as sound made out of clay.

He is currently taking a "gap year" while surveying the current techno-social landscape and searching for the appropriate containers for his upcoming professional and creative projects. -->
<h3>Project Title</h3>
<!-- Provide the title of the transmission artwork you are proposing to work on during your Wave Farm residency. -->
<p>“<em>All Water Understands</em>”</p>
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<!-- Describe the project you are proposing to work on during a Wave Farm Residency. -->
<p>I would like to propose a project that considers waves across different media, in continuation of my recent body of work focused on air as a medium. In <a href="/projects/frog-chorus">Frog Chorus</a>, ephemeral sound sculptuture emerges out of the acoustic interactions between devices, each acting as a transmitter and a receiver within a structure that dynamically interacts with itself and the enveloping environment. In my project for Wave Farm, I’d like to explore ways in which the <em>directedness</em> of interactions in a transmitter-receiver model breaks down as the system becomes more complex, as agents become environment.</p>
<!-- While much of my previous work deals directly with acoustic vibrations in air, the project I am proposing considers waves more broadly.  -->
<!-- The notion of transmission presumes a transmitter and a receiver, and the necessity of some sort of threshold in between. This project considers what happens as that threshold goes to zero, when transmitter and receiver are packed close together, like a body of water. -->
<!-- Transmission implies a transmitter and a receiver, and a medium in between. -->
<!-- My approach to location recordings is to act as a receiver, without a clearly defined transmitter -->
<p>During the residency, I would like to use the hydrophone to record underwater sounds from various bodies of water around Wave Farm, and compose these recordings into a set of modular compositions. As I record these sounds, I would act as a receiver for dense aquatic environments, irreducible to a set of well-defined transmitters. The resulting compositions would then be split up and played synchronously through multiple FM transmitters, each of which would be roughly equidistant to a central FM receiver, positioned such that the signal from each of the transmitters is mixed dynamically based on slight variations in signal strength, and the FM receiver’s ability to lock onto a given source. The sonic result of this experimental style of mixing is difficult to anticipate, so part of the residency would be dedicated to tuning this behavior, and adjusting my approach as needed. In more poetic terms, my aim is to turn the sounds of the water into an evocation of swirling weather.</p>
<p>I would consider these works to be part of my <a href="/projects/airports-for-music">Airports for Music</a> series, which always begin with an intentional act of focused listening while holding the microphone. This proposal has also been inspired in part by a poem titled <em><a href="https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/405/the-social-life-of-water">The Social Life of Water</a></em> by Tony Hoagland, and this text may get incorporated into either the hydrophone-based compositions, or the final performance.</p>
<!-- - Utilize short-distance FM transmitters to beam to a stereo pair of FM receivers. The FM transmitters may interfere with each other, competing for broadcast -->
<!-- - Social life of water … but with em waves all around us … transmission presumes there is a transmitter and a receiver, a threshold between, but what if that threshold is diffuse and expansive, like the weather, not really a threshold at all? Instead of transmission, we sit at the threshold as if on the shore of a great ocean or lake. In the performance, the poem will be read multiple times, transmitted also, though it may not make it through to the receiver -->
<h3>Live Performance for an Expanded Studio Audience Description</h3>
<!-- Describe the live radio broadcast and culminating public event for your residency. -->
<p>In the live performance, compositions made using hydrophone recordings will be mixed live for the in-person and radio audience. The performance will have a sculptural quality, in that the compostions will be transmitted via multiple FM transmitters, with a single FM receiver responsible for mixing the various sources and relaying the mixed signal to the P.A. system and radio broadcast. Once set up, the installation will be self-evolving, but as part of the performance, I will physically manipulate the FM receiver in order to modulate the live mix. The live performance may also include a reading of <em><a href="https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/405/the-social-life-of-water">The Social Life of Water</a></em>, which inspired this work.</p>
<h3>Technical Support Needs</h3>
<!-- Please outline what technical support, if any, you will require in order to create your proposed project. -->
<p>Minimal support will be needed for this project, aside from guidance on using the hydrophone, FM transmitters, and other pieces of equipment in the Wave Farm studios.</p>
<h3>Work Samples/Supporting Materials</h3>
<!-- Submit at least one URL linking to at least one, and no more than three examples of past works relevant to your proposal. -->

<!-- All water is a part of other water.
Cloud talks to lake; mist
speaks quietly to creek.

Lake says something back to cloud,
and cloud listens.
No water is lonely water.
 
All water is a part of other water.
River rushes to reunite with ocean;
Tree drinks rain and sweats out dew;
Dew takes elevator into cloud;
Cloud marries puddle;
                                                  puddle

has long conversation with lake about fiord;
Fog sneaks up and murmurs insinuations to swamp;
Swamp makes needs known to marshland;

Thunderstorm throws itself on estuary;
Waterspout laughs at joke of frog pond.
All water understands.

All water understands.
Reservoir gathers information
for database of watershed;
Brook translates lake to waterfall;
Tide wrinkles its green forehead and then breaks through.
All water understands.

But you, you stand on the shore
of blue Lake Kieve in the evening
and listen, grieving
as something stirs and turns within you.

Not knowing why you linger in the dark.
Not able even to guess
from what you are excluded. -->

<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
<p>In 1982, the Dutch physicist and sound artist, Felix Hess, began producing sound installations based on frogs, whose entrancing song he first encountered in the hillsides of Adelaide in Australia. On returning to the Netherlands, he began developing frog-robots, each outfitted with a microphone, speaker, and circuitry, enabling them to listen for and sing to each other to produce choruses of frog-song like those he had heard in Australia.</p>
<p>The project I propose is to translate Felix’s original work with frog-robots into a web-app, allowing a group of participants to summon their own frog chorus using their mobile devices, an act of making algorithm audible. This work is intended to exist partly as performance - a single phone running the app will make very little sound on its own. Instead, when a group of people runs this app on their phones together, what will emerge is a dynamic and responsive sound environment that is spatially distributed and self-interacting. In having each phone as a frog within the chorus, the participant-listeners are invited to put their phones down and join in an exercise of active listening as they walk around their phones as ephemeral sound sculpture. While participants will require internet access in order to load the app in the browser, no other networking protocols (e.g. bluetooth or websockets) will be used to facilitate interation; these devices will interact only acoustically.</p>
<hr>
<section style="margin: 20px 30px">
<h4>Suggestion for a listening-performance</h4>
In a gathering of five or more people (ideally, many more) with smartphones running the app in a browser, consider the following actions.
<ul>
<li>Walk in a slow, undirected manner with your phone (frog) until you find a good place to set it down.</li>
<li>Notice how the other participants are setting down their phones (frogs) too, and remain quiet as the frogs (phones) settle into their environment, slowly beginning to make their calls.</li>
<li>Focus on the sound of your frog, apart from the other frogs. Wander further away from your frog, until you can no longer distinguish which which frog is yours.</li>
<li>Consider what it feels like to be separated from your frog (phone), witnessing it absorbed in the act of listening and singing?</li>
<li>After a while, leave the frog chorus, either bringing your phone with you, or not.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>While the idea for this project originally occurred to me nearly a decade ago, I was saddened to learn of <a href="https://www.aviationanalysis.net/physicist-and-installation-artist-felix-hess-81-has-died/">Felix’s passing late last year</a>, and I had the realization that I have been sitting on this project for too long. His body of work is one that I’ve found inspiring for many years, and unfortunately seems to be little known within the larger arc of post-war European sound art, and even within his native country of the Netherlands.</p>
<p>But while remaining faithful to Felix’s original work, this project also aims to extend it with an investigation of what it means to live in a world increasingly of machines talking to each other. In nature, frog behavior can by characterized by <a href="https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100323792;jsessionid=B3CD8ED4F256F338961508B97BB9BD3E#:~:text=The%20movement%20of%20an%20organism,predator%20(i.e.%20negative%20phonotaxis).">phonotaxis</a> (the movement of an organism with respect to sound), which I take as a poetic metaphor for how we might navigate algorithmically-determined environments. In an age where machines give increasingly convincing impressions of “aliveness”, the simple act of listening may serve as an act of resistance, a place from which to understand how our own aliveness is not like that of a machine. To give a clearer voice to the intentions, aims, and historical context of this project, I would also like to write an informal essay that attempts to connect Felix’s work to current discourses around sound art, deep listening, embodied perception, and technology.</p>
<p>This project is also imagined to be the first phase of a larger project that explores the usage of smartphone devices for algorithmically-based composition and listening. Ultimately, I would like to build a platform that allows contributors to compose music for this sort of system, in which a number of smartphones within acoustic proximity respond to each other sonically. This system is also inherently limited by the quality of the built-in speaker and microphone, which is acoustically low-tech relative to now standard consumer products developed for music listening (like Bluetooth speakers). However, my hope is that the listening experience is heightened by the social component of a shared listening experience, which may be a helpful reminder to audiences that the hermetic listening practices fostered by the likes of Spotify and virtual reality cannot presume to circumscribe all of what it means for us to listen, to, and with our devices.</p>


<h2 id="technical-description">Technical Description</h2>
<p>This project will be entirely web-based and optimized for mobile devices (though laptops and desktop computers will not be excluded). The project can either be self-hosted, or hosted on a domain provided by <a href="http://websoundart.org">websoundart.org</a>. It will consist of JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, and HTML, and may contain additional dependencies to third-party libraries such as <a href="https://meyda.js.org/">meyda.js</a>. Depending on the deployment architecture, it will likely be a single-page application built with a simple reactive framework such as Svelte (and not a heavier framework, such as React). GitHub and git versioning will be used to share code and updates as the project progresses, and documentation for the project will be written to give other artists and developers a foundation to build similar projects.</p>
<p>This project relies entirely on the Web Audio API (supported in all standard web browsers), which will provide the basis of how each device listens to its environment and makes frog sounds (from audio samples). The basic operation of the app is to apply real-time audio analysis operations to the device’s microphone input, and determine whether frog sounds are being heard, or not.</p>

</figure>
<p>I’ve used the Web Audio API before to build creative software projects before, like the one powering <a href="https://p-a-n.org/release/james-hoff-hobo-ufo-v-chernobyl/">Hobo UFO</a>, in which camera movements within Google Maps Street View are controlled dynamically by analysizing audio in real-time. I’m confident that the Web Audio API will provide all the functionality required to power this application (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform#:~:text=A%20fast%20Fourier%20transform%20(FFT,frequency%20domain%20and%20vice%20versa.)">fast fourier transform</a> analysis of an incoming audio signals, and playback of predetermined audio files). The trickiness of this project, however, will be in calibrating the behavior, to be neither too sensitive nor too coarse. It could be interesting to use machine learning to improve the capacity for detecting frog sounds, but its implementation would take time and may detract from other interesting aspects of the project’s development. Accessibility and screen-reader usability are also high priorities for this project, and I would like to align this project towards an internet that is more heard than seen/read.</p>
<p>I would aim to have the bulk of the programming finished at least halfway through the allotted timeline, so that sufficient time can be devoted to field-testing the app. I would like to note, however, that QA for this project will always be necessarily incomplete, due to the wide range of devices and environments possible. But even in the event that a group of participants fails to get their devices to sing to each other, the poetic capacity for such an event occuring is sufficient to consider any given performance to be successful. According to Felix himself, his frog-robots were so sensitive that in order for his installations to work, <a href="https://bldgblog.com/2008/04/space-as-a-symphony-of-turning-off-sounds/">he would sometimes need to go around turning off every possible thing that was making sound</a>, such as HVAC systems and other electrical appliances. In this sense, every technical failure is a creative opportunity.</p>
