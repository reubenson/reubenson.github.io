          <figcaption>
            From a series of "casa mugs", produced with a kurinuki carving technique, in which the vessel and door-like handle is carved out, and the surface is left untouched by further interventions, bearing the marks of how it has been stored and handled in the industrial plastic bag the clay was obtained from.

          <figcaption>
            Miniature vessel loosely inspired by a classical amphora. Thrown off the hump, with handles attached as an exploration of the balance of form.

          <figcaption>
            Another exploration of the balance of form in a miniature vessel, roughly the dimensions of a quarter.

          <figcaption>
            A small creamer commissioned by a friend. Japanese tea wares were the original point of inspiration, but as I experimented with the surface, the piece ended up taking on an appearance more like the titular character from Jan Svankmajer's 2000 film, <em>Little Otik</em>, featuring an infant in the form of small tree.

          <figcaption>
            Developing a theme around organic forms, rocks in this case, this pinch-pot rattle encloses a number of small clay beads.

          <figcaption>
            Another closed-form pinch pot, also evocative of a natural form, with a small aperture for use as a weed pot.

          <figcaption>
            The most recent in a series of udus (clay drum) I've been prototyping. Unlike a traditional Nigerian udu, which is formed through coil-building, this is produced more like a moon jar, with two wheelthrown vessels attached at the rim.
