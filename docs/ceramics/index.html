          <figcaption>
            From a series of "casa mugs", produced with a kurinuki carving technique, in which the vessel and door-like handle is carved out, and the surface is left jagged and rough, largely untouched by any surface intervention.

          <figcaption>
            Miniature vessel loosely inspired by a classical amphora. Thrown off the hump, with handles attached as an exploration of the balance of form.

          <figcaption>
            Another exploration of the interplay of forms in a miniature vessel.

          <figcaption>
            A small creamer commissioned by a friend. Japanese sake cups were the original point of inspiration, but as I experimented with the surface, the piece ended up taking on an appearance more like the titular character from Jan Svankmajer's film, <em>Little Otik</em>, featuring an infant child in the form of small tree.

          <figcaption>
            Developing a theme around organic forms, this is a rattle, with small clay beads enclosed within a pinch-pot. The goal of this sculptural form was inspired by the idea of rocks.

          <figcaption>
            The most recent in a series of udus I've been prototyping. Unlike a traditional Nigerian udu, which is formed through coil-building, this is produced more like a moon jar. It is intended for use as a percussion instrument, though I've not yet been able to achieve quite the desired acoustic properties.

          <figcaption>
            Like the previous piece, this vessel explores the use of engobe, but also experiments with introducing a subtle pictorial element.
