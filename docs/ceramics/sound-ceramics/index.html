    These udus (clay drums) are part of an ongoing set of prototypes I've been developing as part of a new body of work around sonically-focused ceramics. Although traditional udu vessels are formed through coil-building, I produce mine in the Korean tradition of moon jars, in which two wheel-thrown bowls are slipped, scored, and joined at the midsection.
