  <figcaption>These vessels are from an ongoing series of "casa mugs", produced through carving into the clay to produce the vessel and handle. The exterior surface is untouched by any direct surface intervention, as I intended to have the surface preserve the imprints and indentations from contact with the plastic bag the clay arrived in.</figcaption>
