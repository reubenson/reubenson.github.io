    In the summer of 2023, I attended a workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at <em>The Haystack Mountain School of Crafts</em>. These photos document the pieces I designed and fabricated during that time, in which I focused on two atypical qualities for ceramic sculpture: the line and site-specificity. I wrote about my experience at <a href="https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd">https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd</a>
