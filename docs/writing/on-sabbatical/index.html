<p>Towards the end of 2022, I had the feeling that I had lost the thread a bit, professionally and creatively. And so, in 2023, I took a year-long sabbatical to tap into both my inner child and my north star. <em>Where had I been, and where was I going</em>?</p>
<p>Over the last decade or so, my energy and attention had settled around software, sound, and ceramics, but I felt I needed to take to backtrack a little to see what other signposts I may have passed by on the path I was on.</p>

<p>During my sabbatical, I’ve deployed a few browser-based projects, through which I’ve tried to express what I still find beautiful, open-ended, and poetic about computing interfaces. A series of love-letters to the web. For being so turbulent and <em>noisy</em>, the web is also a rather <em>quiet</em> place, in which sound routinely defers to the primacy of text and image. Sound is also among the more numinous of the human senses, and perhaps owing to this, I’ve found it endlessly interesting to develop experimental intefaces around sound, disrupting the <em>affect of determinism</em> that continues to dominate our collective ways of sensemaking.</p>

<p>In <a href="/weaving"><em>Weaving Music</em></a>, which began as a residency project at <a href="https://elektronmusikstudion.se/composers/2019/1013-reuben-son-ems-10-19-june-2019">EMS</a>, I built a grid-based generative music interface that draws inspiration from weaving patterns.</p>

<p>In <a href="/midi-archive"><em>MIDI Archive</em></a>, which came out of a residency at <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, I prototyped a hybrid model of AI and archive as an interface to a historical catalogue of music on the early web.</p>

<!-- I'm still figuring things out, but I'm happy you're here and I hope you enjoy perusing some of the things I've made along the way. While none of these projects are truly _finished_, I do feel like this body of work has connecting throughlines, and has given me the space to think ... and if not find answers, to at least ask better questions. -->
