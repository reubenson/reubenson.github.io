        <p>I’m a creative technologist based in New York City with a multi-disciplinary background in research science, humanities, and the arts. At <a href="https://nymag.com"><em>New York Magazine</em></a> and <em>Vox Media</em>, I worked as an engineering lead, delivering award-winning reader experiences and developing internal editorial tooling. Working closely with design, editorial, and business development teams, I played a leading role in developing <a href="https://nymag.com/strategist">The Strategist</a> during a period of rapid growth in the e-commmerce and affiliate revenue business.</p>
<p>User interfaces are at the core of my work on the web, and I take particular interest in UI as the synthesis of technical affordances with human needs and desires. During a period of professional sabbatical from 2023 into 2024, I’ve developed a number of projects with experimental user interfaces (audio-based device-to-device communication, articulating an archive through AI, algorithmic music generation through weaving notation) that have helped me reaffirm and refine my relationship to making work on the web.</p>
<p>experiments around user interfaces that invert the common UX of developing a funnel, and instead expanding a user’s engagement with the world beyond the computer interface.</p>
<p>As a product-minded engineer who is excited by the synthesis of technical affordances with human needs and desires …
I bring a wide toolkit to questions of how and what to build with technology, and am currently looking out for new professional opportunities as an engineering manager, staff engineer, or co-founder. Please do <a href="mailto:reubenson@gmail.com">get in touch</a> if you think I would be a welcome collaborator with you or someone you know!</p>
<ul>
<li>How is my general practice related to interfaces in general?</li>
<li>How to integrate or hint at my creative practice?</li>
<li>Is there anything from my AI article that I want to reference or incorporate?</li>
<li>Incorporate text on Strategist</li>
<li>One-liner on general tech/engineering philosophy</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/engineering-resume">Link to engineering resume</a></p>
<p>In recent personal work, I’ve explored the usage of mobile devices as sonic architecture in <a href="https://frogchor.us">Frog Chor.us</a> and the intersection of archives, machine learning, and music on the early web in <a href="https://reubenson.com/midi-archive">MIDI ARCHIVE</a>.</p>
<p>I bring a deep, human-centric toolkit to questions of both how and what to build with technology, and am currently looking out for new professional opportunities as an engineering manager, staff engineer, or co-founder. Please do get in touch if you think I would be a welcome collaborator with you or someone you know!</p>
<p>I’m foremost a product-driven developer who is excited by the synthesis of technical affordances with user needs. I began my engineering career at New York Magazine, where much of my tenure was devoted to the development of The Strategist. In close collaboration with product, design, editorial, and business development stakeholders, I played a pivotal role in taking The Strategist from an experimental pop-up vertical to its current position as a significant source of publishing revenue.</p>
