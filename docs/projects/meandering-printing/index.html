      <p>These photos document some of the pieces I designed, fabricated, and activated during a two-week workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at The Haystack Mountain School of Crafts. In this work, I focused on site-specificity and expression of the line, and wrote a brief essay about my process(<a href="https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd">https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd</a>)</p>

<!-- In the summer of 2023, I attended a workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at the [Haystack Mountain School of Crafts](https://www.haystack-mtn.org/). You can read reflections on that workshop [here](https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd), see an image gallery of selected works [here](/ceramics), and check out ceramics for sale on <a href="https://sonceramics.etsy.com">Etsy</a>.

    These photos document some of the pieces I designed and fabricated during a two-week workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at The Haystack Mountain School of Crafts. In this work, I focused on site-specificity and expression of the line, which are atypical for ceramic sculpture, and wrote a brief essay about my process(<a href="https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd">https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd</a>)
