<p>Reuben’s most recent ceramics work was completed during a summer workshop at the <a href="https://www.haystack-mtn.org/">Haystack Mountain School of Crafts</a>, where he protyped and experimented with 3D ceramic printing techniques and bots. You can read reflections on that workshop <a href="https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd">here</a>, see an image gallery of selected works <a href="/ceramics">here</a>, and check out ceramics for sale on <a href="https://sonceramics.etsy.com">Etsy</a>.</p>
