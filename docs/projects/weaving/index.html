      <p><strong><a href="/weaving">Weaving Music</a></strong> is an exploration of the materiality of sound through the metaphor of weaving, with the weaving loom re-imagined as a music sequencer. The seeds of this project were formed when first encountering grid notation for weaving patterns in Anni Albersâ€™ <em>On Weaving</em>, which gave the immediate impression of rhythmic music notation.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2019, I began developing this project during a <a href="https://elektronmusikstudion.se/composers/2019/1013-reuben-son-ems-10-19-june-2019">residency at EMS</a> in Stockholm, where I used MIDI signals generated by this app to control voicings produced on their Buchla and Serge synthesizer systems.</p>

<p>In the end, this project attempts a fairly straightforward translation of weaving notation to music notation, in that patterns are read from left to right as columns along the warp (vertical threads hung on a a weaving loom). In the current version, there are two ways of interpreting how a column should be handled: as octaves (in octave mode) or as a canon (in canon mode). These different mode offer different expressions of the underlying harmonic structure, which this app leaves intentionally simplified (as a selection from a variety of chords), such that the resulting music is an expression of an underlying harmonic structure.</p>
<p>In sharing this software, my hope is that you too may find it useful for harmonic and rhythmic research and discovery, sharing some similarity in intent to the historical <a href="https://till.com/articles/muse/">Triadex Muse</a>.</p>
