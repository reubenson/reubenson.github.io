<p><em><strong><a href="https://frogchor.us">Frog Chorus</a></strong></em> is an audio-based web application that allows your mobile device or laptop to chirp in a “chorus” of other devices, as if they were a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPAchkz76c8">chorus of frogs in the wild</a>.</p>
<p>The app uses the built-in speaker and microphone to have devices listen to and interact with each other, generating a dynamic and spatialized work of sound sculpture. Running <em>Frog Chorus</em> on a single device may generate a few peeps, but will not yield a chorus without proximity to other devices running the app. Instead, <em>Frog Chorus</em> requires active participation from a group, and invites users to become listeners and consider what might come from letting machines do all the talking.</p>
<p>This project is dedicated to the memory of the Dutch physicist and sound artist, Felix Hess, whose <em><a href="https://isea-archives.siggraph.org/art-events/electronic-sound-creatures-by-felix-hess/">Electronic Sound Creatures</a></em> work was a direct inspiration for this project.</p>
