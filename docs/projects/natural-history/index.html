<p>Dust has settled, and below that become sediment. This work came out of an extended period of attuned listening and experimentation with sound. Searching for sound, finding it, recording it, layering it with other material.</p>
<p>Sometime around 2005, my interest in cassette tape machines began. It began with listening, and then simple experiments with taping over the erase head, to see what accidents of collaging and palimpsest would emerge. Over time I experimented with further modifications, spreading a cassette over two machines, letting the magnetic tape travel longer distances.</p>
<p>Letting electromechanical processes insert themselves into the document. Not so much a document but a staging area for accidents to occur. And then the difficulty of reproducibility, wanting to assert control. Introducing the DAW as a place to arrange accidents, giving structure to material, but wanting the material to express itself honestly. When does surface register as surface, and not material?</p>
<p>Listening back now, almost a decade later (and many levels of decathexis), I can hear myself listening. Trying to locate a landscape behind my eyes. Like Luc Ferrari’s figure of the “sound hunter” – &quot;the interior landscape modifies the external night, composing it, he juxtaposes his own reality (imagination of reality); or can one say, psychoanalysis of his landscape of night.” Only years, when I feel that that this work has really gotten to its end, does it feel like a document of a period of time in my life when I felt that sound could save me, and then the decathexis of sound from my life, and now seeing how sound did save my life.</p>
