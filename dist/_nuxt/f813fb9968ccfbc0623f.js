Each output has been wired in series with a momentary switch that is 'off' by default and allows signal to pass only upon pressing the switch corresponding to each pickup. As a result, the guitar can no longer be played in the traditional fashion. Through operation of the switches, vibrations from the guitar or extrinsic electromagnetic signals in the vicinity of pickups themselves may be directed to either, neither, or both channels in a highly controlled but crude fashion. While pioneering guitarists such as Keith Rowe and Christian Fennesz have worked to expand and extend the 'language' of electric guitars, 'Breaking Guitar' takes an opposite approach in which the vocabulary is radically reduced. Such a breakdown of musical language enables the articulation of distortions and gaps in the relationship between site (the guitar) and the production of sound.\n\n  ")]),t._v(" "),r("div",{staticClass:"pbox",staticStyle:{display:"none"},attrs:{id:"div4"}},[r("h2",{attrs:{id:"widget-title"}},[t._v("Musique Electronique")]),t._v(" "),r("div",{attrs:{id:"page-bar"}}),t._v(" "),r("a",{staticClass:"fancybox-thumbs",attrs:{rel:"group","data-fancybox-group":"thumbs",href:"https://s3.amazonaws.com/privatechronology/assets/DSCF3890.JPG"}},[r("img",{attrs:{src:"https://s3.amazonaws.com/privatechronology/assets/DSCF3890.JPG",width:"100%"}})]),t._v(" "),r("iframe",{attrs:{width:"100%",height:"20",scrolling:"no",frameborder:"no",src:"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/173072739&color=666666&show_artwork=false&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_user=false&show_reposts=false"}}),t._v(" "),r("div",{attrs:{id:"page-bar"}}),t._v('\n\n    "Electronic Music for the Metropolitan Waterworks Museum" is a short site-specific piece composed for and recorded at the historic water pumping station located in Brookline, MA on November 20, 2013.\n    Over its brief duration, a small selection of electronically synthesized sounds were projected into the large, open room containing three massive, decomissioned steam pumps.
