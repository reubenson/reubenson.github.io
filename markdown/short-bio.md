Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in Brooklyn, NY) makes software, sound, and ceramics. Across these different media, he approach works towards balances of form and function. His work is non-conceptual, priviliging instead, the embodied experience, which may be composed of sub-disciplines around UX (in the case of the software), time (in the case of sound), and space (in the case of ceramics).
