# About
This project is built with Eleventy, and hosted via GitHub pages at https://reubenson.com. In keeping with Github Pages reliance on Jekyll, static site pages are served from /docs.

Eleventy seems like a good enough choice for now, to build pages statically with minimal fuss. The underlying content is composed from modular markdown files, which allows the homepage[https://reubenson.com], [portfolio](https://reubenson.com/portfolio), things like CVs to be maintained together. Not really sure what most of this content is for at the moment, aside from being useful when applying to residencies.

## Getting Started
To get the app serving locally at localhost:8080:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Deployments
`npm run dev` already handles static site generation, so all you need to do is push to origin.
