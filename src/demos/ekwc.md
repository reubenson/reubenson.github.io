I recently produced a mixed media sculpture (_After Orpheus_) that combines ceramics with steel piano wire, electronics, and a paper cup that allowed exhibition visitors to interact with the steel wire and provide an intimate mode of listening (without speakers).

This sculpture includes a wheelthrown ceramic bell that acoustically amplifies the sound of the vibrating wire, but my intention is to further evolve this sculpture by experimentation in the ceramic form. Throughout the residency at EKWC, I would use a combination of traditional techniques and 3D printing of molds to develop a collection of forms that would work together as an ensemble of sound sculptures. Although the sculpture I've produced so far was presenented alone, my intention is to present these sculptures as a room-scale installation with multiple sculptures of different voicings.
\
\
I would use the 3D mold-making capacities at EKWC extensively for creating complex or modular forms, and the Soundlab at EKWC would be especially helpful for analysing the acoustics of vessels and guiding experimentation over the residency.

<!-- The original form I've produced is bell-shaped, which was conceptually motivated by the idea of the horn of an instrument, but forms that are more closed would produce more interesting interactions between the piano wire and the ceramics.  -->

<!-- This sculpture is part of a body of work (in progress) in which ceramic vessels are activated through a variety of physical means. Although this sculpture could be also placed outdoors and activated by the wind, here the indoor installation relies instead on electromagnetic activation (via e-bow).
\
\
The sculpture takes inspiration from the long tradition of aeolian instruments activated by the wind and the myth of Orpheus's lyre, said to have moved stones.

<!-- A pile of bricks, a ceramic bell, and a c-stand frame the physical tension of a long steel wire that quietly sings. With a cup held up against the wire, you can almost hear a willing of stones to dance once more, the ghost of the lyre of Orpheus. -->

<!-- The Soundlab at EKWC would be especially helpful for analysing the acoustics of vessels and guiding experimentation over the residency period. I would also utilize the 3D moldmaking capacities at EKWC to develop more complex or modular forms. -->

I have practiced ceramics for six years, but my creative practice is more broadly rooted in sound, and one of my guiding aims in ceramics is to explore the various forms of silence and resonance inherent to ceramic forms. One of my strongest influences in thinking about sound and space is the Dutch sound artist Felix Hess, who has inspired previous works I've made.

<!-- I would not intend to use my time at EKWC to develop all the sculptures necessary for an upcoming exhibition, and instead would plan to develop a library of CAD files for mold-making that would be used for production at a later time and subject to ongoing research and experimentation. -->
