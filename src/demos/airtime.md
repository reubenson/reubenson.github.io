Suddenly, you notice the light; it's doing something beautiful. You reach for your phone, take a photo. But what if it's the air itself, and not the light, that has suddenly caught your attention?
{.project-grid-item-6}

<!-- You take a deep breath, and perhaps take a photo even though the air is only _in between_ ... -->

When your phone is placed **screen-down**, the AIRTIME mobile app goes into _recording mode_: it processes input from the sky-facing camera and built-in microphone to automatically generate an audio-visual artifact, which is not a direct recording. Instead, it uses musique concrète techniques and generative processes (not necessarily AI) to create an interpretation of place: environment distilled into an "_aerial snapshot_". Your phone cannot be used for other purposes for the duration of this process, which doesn't have a predetermined duration; just the time you want to give this moment (3-5 minutes might be a good baseline).

<!-- This is neither meditation nor deep listening, but a moment of reverie and lightness to let your attention drift gently up to the sky.

<!-- While sharing some similarities to "ambient music", this sound comes from a specific context and place, . -->
<!-- The smartphone makes certain acts of documentation (i.e. taking a photo) trivially accessible, but our memory and senses drift from the _indexical_. For this project, I found myself going back to Luc Ferrari's _Presque Rien_ and Irv Teibel's _The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore_ as giving poetic license to deviate from faithful representations of objective reality, and to stage the creation of memory as an imaginative and poetic act. -->

AIRTIME will preserve your _aerial snapshots_, which are intended to augment your memory of these moments, how the air felt on your skin, in your lungs, and against your ears. At a later time, you can listen back to the snapshot at home, which you can imagine as vapour pouring out of your speakers like a Muji scent diffuser, as if filling your room with other air. In previous projects, I've called this a **sound fragrance**.

A collective archive of _aerial snapshots_ will be preserved within the app, which can also be shared to other users and the rest of the web. While Spotify and wellness apps can algorithmically tailor to you an infinte void of contextless ambient music, AIRTIME isn't about productivity or commodified "wellness". But instead: a way of focusing on listening as a way of shaping reality. It is intended to nurture the potentiality of **reverie** (see [G. Bachelard](https://www.beacon.org/The-Poetics-of-Reverie-P16.aspx)) in small but potent passing moments in our lives, which can only happen away from the screen.

       <em>Very</em> loose sketch of UI for an index of aerial snapshots. Music (and video?) will play when a snapshot is selected. Inspiration for the way AIRTIME treats audio comes from the late 1960's, when Luc Ferrari's <a href="https://maison-ona.com/catalog-0059ONA" target="_blank">Presque Rien</a> and Irv Teibel's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environments_(album_series)#:~:text=Environments%201%20(1969)" target="_blank">The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore</a> began exploring the fluidity and tension between memory and recording.

<!-- The drift of memory and sensation from the _indexical_ is unavoidable,  -->
<!-- Prior to Brian Eno's coining of the term "ambient music", In the late 1960's Luc Ferari's "Presque Rien" and Irv Teibel's "The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore" arrived at an overlapping set of strategies that dealt with the psychoacoustic aspects of environmental sound. In both cases, site-specific audio recordings were subject to modifications and compositional strategies that deviated from original recordings (and therefore less faithful to the "original") while also composing an experience for the listener that went beyond the merely documentary. While Teibel's piece magnifies a sense of the ocean, Ferrari's "Presque Rien" is a through-composed piece that places naturalistic elements (like cricket sounds) in linear time, which sounds plausible as an unedited recording, but is in fact carefully composed and constructed. -->
