Suddenly, you notice the light is doing something very beautiful. You reach for your phone, take a photo. But what if it's the air itself, and not the light, that has suddenly caught your attention? You take a deep breath, and perhaps take a photo even though you know the air won't come through ...

When your phone is placed screen-down, the "Airtime" mobile app processes input from the sky-facing camera and built-in microphone to generate an audio-visual artifact, which is not a direct recording. Instead, it uses musique concrète techniques and generative processes (not necessarily AI) to create an interpretation of place: environment-as-mood distilled into a _aerial snapshot_. Your phone is unusable for the duration of this process, which doesn't have a predetermined duration; just the time you want to give this moment, to notice the air and the still and moving things in it. Something like 3-5 minutes would be a good general baseline though.

The app preserves an archive of your _aerial snapshots_, which are intended to augment your memory of that moment, how the air felt on your skin, in your lungs and against ears. At a later time, you can listen back to the snapshot at home, which you can imagine as vapour pouring out of your speakers like a Muji scent diffuser, filling your room with air from the moment you took that snapshot. In previous projects, I've called this type of sonorous object a _sound fragrance_. While sharing some similarities to "ambient music", this sound comes from a specific place, which it is meant to evoke without relying on an objective representation.

The smartphone makes certain acts of documentation (i.e. taking a photo) trivially accessible, but our memory and senses drift from the _indexical_. For this project, I found myself going back to Luc Ferrari's _Presque Rien_ and Irv Teibel's _The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore_ as giving poetic license to deviate from faithful representations of objective reality, and to stage the creation of memory as an imaginative and poetic act.

<!-- The drift of memory and sensation from the _indexical_ is unavoidable,  -->
<!-- Prior to Brian Eno's coining of the term "ambient music", In the late 1960's Luc Ferari's "Presque Rien" and Irv Teibel's "The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore" arrived at an overlapping set of strategies that dealt with the psychoacoustic aspects of environmental sound. In both cases, site-specific audio recordings were subject to modifications and compositional strategies that deviated from original recordings (and therefore less faithful to the "original") while also composing an experience for the listener that went beyond the merely documentary. While Teibel's piece magnifies a sense of the ocean, Ferrari's "Presque Rien" is a through-composed piece that places naturalistic elements (like cricket sounds) in linear time, which sounds plausible as an unedited recording, but is in fact carefully composed and constructed. -->
