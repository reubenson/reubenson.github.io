  ### against rain
  
  spreads water to hair
  
  sheets coalesce

  to translucent cone

  of dewy plastic
  
  <br/>

  enclosed
  
  green stems make their way
  
  a step backwards

  and backwards
  
  followed closey by
  
  another
  
  they make their way home

<div class="poem">

  ### everything you already know

  dawn, whispering
  
  comes
  
  down
  
  from
  
  the
  
  trees

  you walk so lightly
  
  you carry the wind

  under your feet
</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### a certain weight

  of tapered wood

  of curling arc
  
  everything you can throw
  
  to the wind
  
  to you
  
  floats on
  
</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### instead of being a snow-eater

  when free
  
  of confining fjords

  acquire heat and moisture

  frictional contrasts

  that disconnect the flow

</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### oscillations

  the dust in your brain
  
  <!-- oscillates -->
  
  settles like swept dunes
  
  in silence
  
  a ghost paces
  
  in neat and rhythmic lines 
  
  a window and it is all
  
  you open 
  
  around you
</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### albedo of glaciers
  
  In summer it is most persistent
  
  persistent
  
  blanket of thick moisture-rich clouds
  
  Warmed by descent
  
  from the crest
  
  forcing lake waves into the mouths of rivers
  
  <br/>

  A clatter of saucer
  
  and cup appears
  
  the receding tide of foam
  
  to soft brown lace
  
  yawning for air
</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### that rustles

  colder air is
  
  denser

  and it sinks.

  holding diaphragm, rising breath
  
  the sound

  that rustles

  <!-- I cannot get enough of -->
  
  every thing
  
  is quieter in the shadow
  
  of a leaf
</div>


<!-- prevented them from drying their laundry<span class="line-break"></span> -->

<!-- and yet -->
