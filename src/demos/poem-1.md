  ### rain
  
  spreads water to hair
  
  coalesces

  to a translucent sheet
  
  a cone

  of dewy plastic
  
  <br/>

  enclosed, splashy
  
  green stems
  
  they wind their way
  
  a step backwards

  <br/>

  and backwards
  
  followed closely by
  
  another
  
  they wind their way
  
  home

</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### everything you already know

  dawn comes whispering
  
  comes down from
  
  the trees

  <br/>

  you walk so lightly
  
  you carry the wind

  under your feet

</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### a certain weight

  of tapered wood

  of curling arc

  <br/>
  
  everything you can throw
  
  to the wind
  
  floats on back

  to you
  
</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### instead of being a snow-eater

  winds rise in the north
  
  when free
  
  of confining fjords


  <br/>

  acquire heat and moisture

  frictional contrasts

  that disconnect the flow

</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### oscillations

  the dust in your brain
  
  <!-- oscillates -->
  
  settles like swept dunes
  
  under a blanket of silence

  <br/>
  
  a ghost paces
  
  in neat and rhythmic lines

  tracing stillness

  <br/>
  
  a window
  
  you open 
  
  and it is all around you
</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### albedo of glaciers
  
  In summer it is most persistent
  
  persistent
  
  blanket of thick moisture-rich clouds
  
  Warmed by descent
  
  from the crest
  
  forcing lake waves into the mouths of rivers
  
  <br/>

  A clatter of saucer
  
  and cup appears
  
  the receding tide of foam
  
  to soft brown lace
  
  yawning for air

</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### that rustles

  colder air is
  
  denser

  and it sinks.

  holding diaphragm, rising breath
  

  <br/>

  the sound, that rustles

  <!-- I cannot get enough of -->
  
  every thing
  
  is quieter in the shadow
  
  of a leaf
</div>

it is as if
