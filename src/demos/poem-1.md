  <!-- ### everything you already know -->

  dawn comes whispering
  
  down
  
  from the trees
  
  <br/>

  exhaling under tilting blue expanse

  earth fuming petrichor

  rises &
  
  wafts

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### you walk so -->

  you walk so
  
  lightly
  
  you carry the wind

  under your feet

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### or down here -->

  listlessly sounding

  up there

  or down here 

  <br/>

  as if teeming

  multiplying the air into air

  and more air

  <br/>

  as if speeding

  crashing vapors into abstraction

  and the other way around

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### or down here -->

  stunned into stillness

  when swirling mass cracks
  
  in half under thin white
  
  tines of forking light

</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### rain
  
  spreads water to hair
  
  coalesces

  to translucent sheet
  
  a cone

  of dewy plastic
  
  <br/>

  enclosed,

  and enclasped
  
  green stems hold
  
  their bloom
  
  as they wind their way
  
  backwards

  and back

  <!-- <br/>

  and backwards
  
  followed closely by
  
  another
  
  they wind their way
  
  home -->

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### a certain weight -->

  tapered wood

  curling arc under voices

  of the night sky

  <br/>

  you throw everything into the wind

  that you want to float on

  back

  <!-- into the epidermal ridges of your hand -->
  
  <!-- everything you can throw
  
  to the wind
  
  floats on back

  to you -->
  
</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### instead of being a snow-eater

  winds rise in the north
  
  when free
  
  of confining fjords

  <br/>

  acquiring heat and moisture

  frictional contrasts

  that disconnect the flow

  <br/>

  between the gentle breeze

  and the pale and shearing

  contempt of your inner thermal reservoir

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### albedo of glaciers -->
  
  in summer it is most persistent
  
  persistent
  
  blanket of thick moisture-rich clouds

  <br/>
  
  warmed by descent
  
  from the crest
  
  forcing lake waves into the mouths of rivers
  
</div>

<div class="poem">

  ### a clatter of saucer

  <!-- <br/> -->
  
  and cup appears
  
  the receding tide of foam
  
  to soft brown lace
  
  yawning for air

</div>

<div class="poem">

<!-- ### night -->

the aura of night itself

a chorus of frogs

singing from

the vast library of air

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### rustle -->

  colder air is
  
  denser

  and it sinks.
  

  holding diaphragm, or diaresis
  
  the sound, that rustles

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- I cannot get enough of -->
  
  every thing
  
  is quieter in the shadow
  
  of a leaf

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### oscillations -->

  the dust in your brain
  
  <!-- oscillates -->
  
  settles like swept dunes
  
  over epochs of stone

  <br/>
  
  a ghost paces
  
  still and moving lines

  tracing every breath

  <br/>
  
  a window
  
  you open 
  
  and it is all around you
  
</div>
