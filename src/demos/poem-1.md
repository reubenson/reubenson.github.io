<div class="poem">

  dawn comes whispering down
  
  from the trees 

  <div class="line-break"></div>
  
  exhaling under thin blue expanse

  earth-fuming petrichor

  rises &
  
  wafts

</div>

<div class="poem">

  holding diaphragm, or 
  
  adorning diaresis

  you bask

  and tilt under the rolling sky
  
</div>

<div class="poem">
  <!-- <div class="line-break"></div> -->

  rippling aerial choreography dances the ear

</div>

<div class="poem">

  intoxicated by 
  
  the pure albedo of glaciers


  <div class="line-break"></div>

  you walk so

  lightly

  you carry the wind under your feet
</div>

<div class="poem">
  
  rain spreads water
  
  to hair
  
  coalesces to translucent sheet
  
  a cone of dewy plastic
  
  <div class="line-break"></div>

  enclasped green stems hold their 
  
  blooms as they wind their way

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### instead of being a snow-eater -->

  winds rise in the north
  
  when free
  
  of confining fjords
  
  acquiring heat and moisture

  <div class="line-break"></div>

  frictional contrasts

  that disconnect the flow

</div>

<div class="poem">
  
  in summer it is most persistent
  
  <!-- persistent -->
  <div class="line-break"></div>
  
  a blanket of thick moisture-rich clouds

  
  warmed by descent
  
  from the crest
  
  forcing lake waves into the mouths of rivers
  
</div>

<div class="poem">

  as if teeming

  multiplying the air into air

  and more air

  <div class="line-break"></div>

  as if speeding

  crashing vapors into abstraction

  and other forms of statecraft

</div>

<div class="poem">

  <!-- ### or down here -->

  stunned into stillness

  when swirling mass cracks
  
  in half under thin white
  
  tines of forking light

</div>

<div class="poem">

  listlessly sounding

  up there

  or down here 

  <div class="line-break"></div>

  a storm-cloud

  approaches from one or another

  of the neighboring centuries


  <!-- between gentle breezes

  the edifice of hubris

  summons plague-wind -->

  

  <!-- <br/> -->
  <!-- contempt of your inner thermal reservoir -->

  <!-- the hot white of contempt -->
</div>

<div class="poem">

  

  pale red and 
  
  shearing

  seraphim of total caesura
  
  without suture or

  self-cure

  <div class="line-break"></div>

  cold air is denser and it sinks
  
  <!-- ### rustle -->
  
  <!-- the sound, that rustles -->

</div>


<div class="poem">

  a clatter of saucer
  
  and cup appears
  
  the receding tide of foam
  
  yielding soft brown lace yawning
  
  for air

</div>

<div class="poem">

  the dust in your brain
  
  settles like swept dunes
  
  <!-- over epochs of stone -->

  <div class="line-break"></div>
  
  a ghost paces still
  
  and moving
  
  lines

  <div class="line-break"></div>

  tracing breath like
  
  a window you open all around you
  
</div>

<div class="poem">

the aura of night itself frogpondering

<!-- singing from -->

the vast library of air

</div>

<div class="poem">

  every thing
  
  is quieter in the shadow
  
  of a leaf

<!-- </div> -->

  <!-- I cannot get enough of -->
  
  <!-- every thing

</div>

<div class="poem">

  a certain weight of tapered wood

  curling arcs under voices

  of the night sky

  <div class="line-break"></div>
  <!-- ### a certain weight -->

  you throw everything

  <!-- to the wind -->
