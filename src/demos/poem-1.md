  <!-- ### everything you already know -->

  dawn comes whispering

  down
  
  from the trees 
  
  <!-- unlacing dark from near-dark -->

  <div class="line-break"></div>
  
  exhaling under thin blue expanse

  earth fuming petrichor

  rises &
  
  wafts

</div>

<div class="poem">


  holding diaphragm, or 
  
  adorning diaresis

  you bask

  and tilt under the rolling sky

  <!-- everything you can throw
  
  to the wind
  
  floats on back

  to you -->
  
</div>

<div class="poem">

  gathering upon 
  
  the pure albedo of glaciers

  <!-- between rustling green

  breezes
  
  gathering up

  inexorably, yes

  from slow -->


  <div class="line-break"></div>

  you walk so

  lightly

  you carry the wind under your feet
</div>

<div class="poem">
  
  rain spreads water
  
  to hair
  
  coalesces to translucent sheet
  
  a cone of dewy plastic
  
  <div class="line-break"></div>

  enclasped green stems hold
  
  their bloom
  
  as they wind their way
  
  backwards

  and back

  <!-- <br/>

  and backwards
  
  followed closely by
  
  another
  
  they wind their way
  
  home -->

  <!-- ### instead of being a snow-eater -->

  winds rise in the north
  
  when free
  
  of confining fjords
  
  acquiring heat and moisture

  <div class="line-break"></div>

  frictional contrasts

  that disconnect the flow

</div>

<div class="poem">

cold air is
  
  denser

  and it sinks

  <div class="line-break"></div>


  listlessly sounding

  up there

  the edifice of hubris

  <!-- ### albedo of glaciers -->
  
  in summer it is most persistent
  
  <!-- persistent -->
  <div class="line-break"></div>
  
  a blanket of thick moisture-rich clouds

  
  warmed by descent
  
  from the crest
  
  forcing lake waves into the mouths of rivers
  
</div>

<div class="poem">

  as if teeming

  multiplying the air into air

  and more air

  <div class="line-break"></div>

  as if speeding

  crashing vapors into abstraction

  and other forms of statecraft

  of total caesura
  
  without suture or

   an unappointed storm-cloud

  from one or another

<div class="poem">

  a clatter of saucer

  the dust in your brain
  
  <!-- oscillates -->
  
  settles like swept dunes
  
  over epochs of stone

  a ghost paces
  
  still and moving lines

  tracing breath

  a window
