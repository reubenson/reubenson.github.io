Acquire heat and moisture

thundersquall

Warmed by descent from the crest

Instead of being a snow-eater

Albedo of glaciers

When free of confining fjords

forcing lake waves into the mouths of rivers

In summer it is most persistent

persistent blanket of thick moisture-rich clouds

frictional contrasts over the mainland and the ocean that disconnects the flow

prevented them from drying their laundry

there's a certain weightlessness to being here

and yet
