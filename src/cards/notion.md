Hi there! 

I'm a software engineer and creative technologist who is interested in the [Core Product engineering role at Notion](https://boards.greenhouse.io/notion/jobs/4973980003). I've spent much of my career working on a modular and component system for a CMS, and rather curious about Notion's block data model! 

I'm currently transitioning out of a sabbatical, during which I've focused on designing and developing experimental/poetic user interfaces, and would love to chat more about Notion's vision for how people produce and share documents on the web!
