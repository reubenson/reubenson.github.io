## An algorithmic music sequencer

**[Weaving Music](/weaving)** is a web-app that uses weaving diagrams as the basis for creating musical patterns. I began writing this software during a [residency at EMS](https://elektronmusikstudion.se/composers/2019/1013-reuben-son-ems-10-19-june-2019) (Stockholm), to generate multi-voice musical sequences and rhythms that could be played via MIDI through the Buchla and Serge synthesizers at their studios.
