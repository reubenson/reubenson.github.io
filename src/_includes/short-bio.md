Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York) is an interdisciplinary technologist who makes [software](/#software), [sound](/#sound), and [ceramics](/#ceramics). Across these different media, he approaches his work as sculpture, as an engagement with some form of materiality that is ultimately rooted in embodied experience.

As a full-stack software developer, he has worked primarily at media companies (_Vox_ and _New York Magazine_) building out the sites like *[The Strategist](https://nymag.com/strategist)*, but began his programming career within institutions of academic research science. He considers sound art to be his primary creative practice, and has mostly been working in a supporting/collaborative role with artists like Eli Keszler and James Hoff for institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the London ICA. Since 2019, his interest in surface and form has also led to ceramics, which he likes to think of as sound made out of clay.

He is currently taking a "gap year" while surveying the current techno-social landscape and searching for the appropriate containers for his upcoming professional and creative projects.
