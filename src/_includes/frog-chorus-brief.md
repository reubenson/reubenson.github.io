In 1982, the Dutch physicist and sound artist, Felix Hess, began producing installations based on frogs, whose entrancing song he encountered in the hillsides of Adelaide. On returning to the Netherlands, he began developing his own robotic frogs, each outfitted with a microphone, speaker, and circuitry, enabling them to listen for and recognize each other to produce choruses like those he first heard in Australia.

The project I propose is to translate Felix's original work with frog-robots into a web-app, allowing a group of participants to summon their own frog chorus using their phones, the underlying algorithms for behavioral modeling and audio feature extraction made audible. In having each phone as a frog within the chorus, participants are invited to put their phones down and join the other participants in a performance of active listening as they walk amongst their phones.

While remaining faithful to Felix's original work, this project extends it with an implicit critique of what it means to live in a world increasingly comprised of machines talking to each other.

In actuality, frogs behave through phonotaxis (the movement of an organism with respect to sound), which I take as a poetic metaphor for how we might navigate algorithmically-governed environments. In an age where machines more convincingly give an impression of aliveness, the simple act of listening may serve as an act of resistance, reminding us of the ways in which our own aliveness is not like that of a machine.
