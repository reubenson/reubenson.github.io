<!-- I make software, sound, and ceramics.  -->

I'm a Korean-American artist and technologist based in New York City, working primarily with software, sound, and ceramics. My current practice centers on the poetics of air: as environment made audible, as a force upon language, and in the sonorous potentiality of ceramic vessels. Air is both material and metaphor; like meaning itself, it cannot exist in a vacuum. To pay attention to the air is to attend to the liminal, the relational, and the dynamic.

My work is rooted in a background in sound art, and in particular the act of listening itself as a generative space for aesthetic experience. I've been developing work around this through what I call "choreographies of listening." In "After Orpheus" (2025), the exhibition visitor interacts with the sculpture by holding a paper cup. In the "Airs" (2025) poems, the reader moves the collection like the blowing wind. 

Expanding this body of work, I'm currently developing a series of ceramic sculptures and text-based scores that activate the air through listening.

<!-- Reuben Son (lives in New York City) is a Korean-American artist who primarily makes software, ceramics, and sound. His multidisciplinary practice is rooted in sound art, in which he engages the somatic materiality of sound and focuses attention on the act of listening itself. He has presented work in the form of recordings, performances, talks, sculpture, websites, and publications. -->
