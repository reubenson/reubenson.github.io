<!-- I make software, sound, and ceramics.  -->

I'm a Korean-American artist based in New York City working primarily with sound, ceramics, and software. My practice centers on the poetics of air: as environment made audible, as force upon language, and as the sonorous potentiality of ceramic vessels. 
\
\
My work expresses an interest in the core phenomenon of the aesthetic experience, and in particular the generative act of listening. Through recent projects, I've experimented with strategies of choreographing listening. In "After Orpheus" (2025), the exhibition visitor interacts with the sculpture by holding a paper cup. In the "Airs" (2025) poems, the reader moves the collection like the blowing wind. 
\
\
Expanding this body of work, I'm currently developing a series of sculptures and text-based scores that further explore exchanges between object and affect. I believe that the aesthetic experience is irreducible to the object, and the act of multi-attentional listening can be used towards creative and liberatory ends more broadly.

<!-- Reuben Son (lives in New York City) is a Korean-American artist who primarily makes software, ceramics, and sound. His multidisciplinary practice is rooted in sound art, in which he engages the somatic materiality of sound and focuses attention on the act of listening itself. He has presented work in the form of recordings, performances, talks, sculpture, websites, and publications. -->

<!-- As an artist, his work deals with the _air_ as both material and metaphor, explores the sculptural interplay between surface and structure, and examines the exchanges between object and affect. -->
