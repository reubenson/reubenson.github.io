I'm a Korean-American artist and technologist based in New York City, working primarily with software, sound, and ceramics. My recent and ongoing body of work engages what I call "choreographies of listening", in which the act of listening situates the body within the larger environment of the sculptural artwork. For both my ceramics- and software-based works, this emphasis on listening introduces a somatic consideration of materiality and phenomenology beyond traditional qualities of surface and form. 

In "After Orpheus" (2025), the exhibition visitor interacts with a sound sculpture first through its reverberations in the air, and then through a paper cup held against its vibrating steel wire. The poetry-sound collection "Airs" (2025), emerged from my private practice of plein air listening and uses text and sound together to structure an experience of the moving air as a force upon both language and sound. And in the software "Frog Chorus", smartphones generate an interactive sound installation that positions the human act of listening itself alongside that of the machine.

My working methods across various media are unified in prioritizing the poetics of contingency, whereby works cannot be reduced to the conceptual or exercises in abstraction. While my works are often motivated by my readings in poetry, psychoanalysis, and the history of science, my studio practice is essentially an experimental one, through which an originating idea or spark must eventually find its form.

* choreographies of listening, is a phrase that already existed but i think i also did come up with. it captures more than what i'd been saying before abnter-media out composing listening.
* poetics of air, or of contingency feels loose and abstract still, perhaps taking too much liberty.

<!-- I'm a Korean-American artist and technologist based in New York City, working primarily with software, sound, and ceramics. My current practice centers on the poetics of air: as environment made audible, as a force upon language, and in the sonorous potentiality of ceramic vessels. Air is both material and metaphor; like meaning itself, it cannot exist in a vacuum. To pay attention to the air is to attend to the liminal, the relational, and the dynamic.

My work is rooted in a background in sound art, and in particular the act of listening itself as a generative space for aesthetic experience. I've been developing work around this through what I call "choreographies of listening." In "After Orpheus" (2025), the exhibition visitor interacts with the sculpture by holding a paper cup. In the "Airs" (2025) poems, the reader moves the collection like the blowing wind. 

Expanding this body of work, I'm currently developing a series of ceramic sculptures and text-based scores that activate the air through listening. -->
