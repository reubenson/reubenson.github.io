Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York City) is a Korean-American artist who makes ceramics, software, and sound. 
His work, which is broadly sculptural, draws from his engagement with materiality and metaphor across various media.
He is a longtime collaborator with Eli Keszler, whom he has worked with on installations, performances, and recordings since 2011.
