My practice is rooted in the medium of sound, which served as my personal entry-point into a broader world of art-making. Although my practice has expanded to include ceramics, software, and poetry, sound remains the primary medium through which I create meaning from the world around me. Over time, my interest in sound has led me to ask fundamental questions about the somatic aspect of aesthetic experiences, and the poetics of the air itself.  My ongoing work in various disciplines synthesize these interests through engagement with materiality and metaphor, with the aim, as the French Symbolist painter Odilon Redon phrased it, of "putting the logic of the visible at the service of the invisible."

I think of my role as an artist is that of fostering the act of attention (in both its broad and narrow forms, per Marion Milner). Although my existing body of work largely takes the form of non-physical media (websites, sound), they emphasize that aesthetic experiences are not clearly distinguishable from embodied experiences. In this regard, ceramics has been a great teacher to me regarding the relationship between art-making and the body, and continues to inspire me to make work that blurs the senses.
