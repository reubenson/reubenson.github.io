Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York City) is a creative technologist and artist with a multi-disciplinary background in research science, humanities, and the arts. As a software engineer, he has built out sites like _[The Strategist](https://nymag.com/strategist)_, as well as personal projects that combine web interfaces with sound. In addition to his private sound practice, he has also collaborated with artists like Eli Keszler and James Hoff, at institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and Eyebeam. Since 2019, his interest in surface and form has led to a sculptural ceramics practice, which he thinks of as an immediate extension of his work with sound.

 as an engagement with some form of materiality that is ultimately rooted in embodied experience.

As a full-stack software developer, he has worked primarily at media companies (_Vox_ and _New York Magazine_) building out the sites like *[The Strategist](https://nymag.com/strategist)*, but began his programming career within institutions of academic research science. He considers sound art to be his primary creative practice, and has mostly been working in a supporting/collaborative role with artists like Eli Keszler and James Hoff for institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the London ICA. Since 2019, his interest in surface and form has also led to ceramics, which he likes to think of as sound made out of clay.


I'm a product-driven creative technologist based in New York City with a multi-disciplinary background in research science, humanities, and the arts. At New York Magazine and Vox Media, I worked to deliver award-winning reader experiences and critical back-end services in support of editorial tooling and business development goals during a period of rapid growth (400% YoY) in the e-commmerce and affiliate revenue business.

In recent personal work, I've explored the usage of mobile devices as sonic architecture in Frog Chor.us and the intersection of archives, machine learning, and music on the early web in MIDI ARCHIVE.

I bring a deep, human-centric toolkit to questions of both how and what to build with technology, and am currently looking out for new professional opportunities, so please get in touch if you think I would be a welcome collaborator with you or someone you know! -->
