In conversation I sometimes joke that I've finally entered my *verbal* phase of development. Whereas my creative efforts in the past have been directed towards (wordless) music and ceramics, the impetus for this inaugural newsletter is to announce **three recent pieces of writing** (not including this newsletter itself). 

I'm still sorting out what writing means to me, but that said, I do know that I resist Vilém Flusser's claim that the written word is a linear medium. I frequently have the following experience: within the first **½ second** of encountering a block of text, I already know if it contains a specific word of interest before I've "read" anything; and then it is when I linearly scan the text that I confirm its exact location within the text. You might associate this phenomenon to the larger practice of speed reading (which I cannot do).

In the context of writing, the operational modality of contemporary LLMs gestures towards this in another way. Token generation is _linear_, but works within an _n-dimensional_ latent space of possible token generations.

My mental model of contemporary culture tends to fall back into a fundamental hypothesis about the DJ as archetypal figure, one that simultaneously assembles an audience and creates a socio-cultural context. The USB stick they arrive with is the latent space from which linear temporality is structured just-in-time. 

In the larger context of the creator economy, the more successfully you refine your latent space, the more you subject yourself to _audience capture_. The perennial adage "you are what you eat" involves a reciprocal axiom: __you eat what you are__.

Somewhere within this ouroboros of corpus and hallucination, writing, like all non-linear media, may be a strategy for enacting the autophagic ritual of delimiting **latent space**.

### News

Every year gets shorter the older I get. But each winter stays the same, which means each year is proportionally more winter than the last. This last winter I listened to Jessica Pratt's [_Here in the Pitch_](https://jessicapratt.bandcamp.com/album/here-in-the-pitch) almost every day, but to my ears, nothing screams **transition to spring** louder than Khan Jamal's [_Infinity_](https://khanjamal.bandcamp.com/album/infinity); aside from the peeping of frogs, of course.

_**Quiet Time**_ - My essay on background music and environmental attention has been published [online by Are.na Editorial as part of the Naive Yearly series](https://www.are.na/editorial/quiet-time).

_**Airs**_ - A collection of poems accompanied by recordings of the wind has been published in the [Spring 2025 issue of The HTML Review](https://thehtml.review/04/airs). I've also written a bit more background on this project [here](https://reubenson.com/projects/airs).

_**Surface Tension**_ - My essay on the aesthetic experience of surfaces was published in the [2025 Are.na Annual](https://store.are.na/products/are-na-annual-2025?variant=44886611296407) which is available for purchase and you can download a PDF of my essay individually [here](https://reubenson.com/public/downloads/surface-tension.pdf).

And to return to my original impetus for starting this newsletter, I've added a few more items to my [**online ceramics** shop](https://reubenson.com/shop). I'm finally getting back in the ceramics studio, so stay tuned for a bigger shop update later this year.
