A brief **ceramics update**: I’ll be selling some wares as part of a pop-up sale curated and hosted by [Pyperbleu](https://pyperbleu.com/) in Williamsburg. [Open Sat-Sun August 23-24 from 12-6pm](https://pyperbleu.com/cdn/shop/files/CeramicsShow_Letter_3b55d4f5-e9e2-4eb5-80e2-410b57327c06.jpg), with a reception at 3pm Saturday.

"Thus the miniscule, a narrow gate, opens up an entire world. The details of a thing can be the sign of a new world," writes Bachelard in **_The Poetics of Space_**. Taken somewhat literally, the travel vases I've been making over the years have led me to some bigger pieces this year. Earlier this summer I exhibited a new sculptural work, [_After Orpheus_](/projects/after-orpheus), for a show at **Millenium Film Workshop** curated by [Michèl Saint-Michel](https://michelesaintmichel.com/). And in the Pyperbleu show, I'll be debuting the first of a series of lamps.

Every year gets shorter the older I get. But each winter stays the same, which means each year is proportionally **more winter**. This last winter I listened to Jessica Pratt's [_Here in the Pitch_](https://jessicapratt.bandcamp.com/album/here-in-the-pitch) almost every day, but to my ears, nothing screams **transition to spring** louder than Khan Jamal's [_Infinity_](https://khanjamal.bandcamp.com/album/infinity); aside from the peeping of frogs, of course.

_**Quiet Time**_ - My essay on background music and environmental attention has been published [online by Are.na Editorial as part of the Naive Yearly series](https://www.are.na/editorial/quiet-time).

_**Airs**_ - A collection of poems accompanied by recordings of the wind has been published in the [Spring 2025 issue of The HTML Review](https://thehtml.review/04/airs). I've also written a bit more background on this project [here](https://reubenson.com/projects/airs).

_**Surface Tension**_ - My essay on the aesthetic experience of surfaces was published in the [2025 Are.na Annual](https://store.are.na/products/are-na-annual-2025?variant=44886611296407) which is available for purchase and you can download a PDF of my essay individually [here](https://reubenson.com/public/downloads/surface-tension.pdf).

And to return to my original impetus for starting this newsletter, I've added a few more items to my [**online ceramics** shop](https://reubenson.com/shop). I'm finally getting back in the ceramics studio, so stay tuned for a bigger shop update later this year. -->
