Your phone will play a single note. If it feels too loud or too quiet at first, you may adjust the volume to suit your taste. This note will slowly fade to silence over five minutes. As you notice it getting more faint, replace the sound with your own voice by humming or singing, matching the pitch, at whatever volume feels comfortable to you. Think of this note as your breath, starting and stopping in a rhythm that feels natural to you.
