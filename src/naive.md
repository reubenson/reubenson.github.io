Your phone will emit a sound. This sound will vibrate into the air for five minutes. If it feels too loud at first, you may adjust the volume to be quieter. The sound will slowly fade to silence over five minutes. As you notice it getting more faint, replace the sound with your own voice by humming or singing, matching the pitch and trying to keep the volume the same.
