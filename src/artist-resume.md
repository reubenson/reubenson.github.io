# {{ title }}

Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York City) is a Korean-American artist and technologist who makes sound, software, and ceramics. For more than a decade, his sound-based work has engaged the materiality of sound, in the form of magnetic tape or through metaphors of textile weaving and fragrance. In recent work, he has focused on the act of listening itself, both in the compositional process, and in prompting audiences to attend to their own act of listening.
