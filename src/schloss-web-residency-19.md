## Project Description
In 1982, the Dutch physicist and sound artist, Felix Hess, began producing installations based on frogs, whose entrancing song he encountered while researching boomerang aerodynamics at the University of Adelaide. On returning to the Netherlands, he began developing his own robotic frogs, each outfitted with a microphone, speaker, and circuitry, enabling them to listen for and recognize each other to produce choruses like those he first heard in Australia.

The project I propose is to translate Felix's original work with frog-robots into a web-app, allowing a group of participants to summon their own frog chorus using their phones, the underlying algorithms made audible. In having each phone as a frog within the chorus, and using audio feature extraction to allow recognition of other frogs, the project remains faithful to Felix's original work, while adding an implicit critique of what it means to live in a world increasingly comprised of machines talking to each other.

In actuality, frogs operate through phonotaxis (the movement of an organism with respect to sound), which I take as a poetic metaphor for how we might navigate algorithmically-governed environments. Through sound: to privilige embodied aspects of intelligence. In an age where machines more convincingly give an impression of aliveness, the simple act of listening may serve as an act of resistance, reminding us of the ways in which our own aliveness is not like that of a machine.

## Project Format
I wish to present this project in two main parts: (1) a web-app, which may be self-hosted or embedded onto an Academie Schloss webpage; and (2) an essay, which contextualizes the project at the intersection of post-war European sound art, cybernetics and machine learning, and the metaphysics of attention. Additionally, I will be living in Berlin in August and September of this year, and would enjoy leading performances in Germany using this project.
