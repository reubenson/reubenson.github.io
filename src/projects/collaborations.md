With Eli Keszler, I've contributed across a range of roles, ranging from [bassoon performance on _Cold Pin_](https://p-a-n.org/product/eli-keszler-cold-pin-pan-21/) (2011), Arduino microcontroller programming for installations at gallieries like the [MIT List Center](https://listart.mit.edu/exhibitions/open-tunings) (2015), [sound design and live spatialization for a performance at The Whitney](https://whitney.org/events/eli-keszler) (2019), and most recently, a [mixed media sculpture at Galerie Pepe](https://arc.net/l/quote/qgchhwmo) (2024).

With James Hoff, I produced a standalone piece of software that uses realtime audio analysis to programmatically détourn Google Maps Street View into audio-reactive cinematography reminiscent of Michael Snow's [*La Région Centrale*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYr_SvIKKuI).

The resulting project, _Hobo UFO_, debuted at the [London ICA in 2016](https://archive.ica.art/whats-on/ica-associates-pan-present-james-hoff-lee-gamble-steve-warwick-nora-khan-tcf/index.html), and has been presented internationally at galleries and music festivals alike. Many versions of this project were produced from 2016 onwards, culminating in a video published by [PAN](https://p-a-n.org/releases/) in 2019.
