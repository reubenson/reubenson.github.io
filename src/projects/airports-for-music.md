_**[Airports for Music]({{ url }})**_ is an ongoing collection of compositions that juxtapose location recordings with synthetic sound. While inspired in part by *acoustic ecology* and site-specific art, these pieces are produced with a looser guiding metaphor, of sound as a fragrance: aerosolized materiality suspended in air, carried gently to the listener's ears.

Works in this collection have been serially published to [Nina Protocol](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/) as an experiment with self-publishing alternatives to the existing major streaming platforms. In particular, this project benefits from being able to associate the music with a primary body of text, and can easily include works by other interested contributors.

<!-- Similar to distilling a fragrance, I think of this project as exploration  -->

<!-- There's an inherent _lossiness_ to making location recordings, which reduce all the sensory dimensions of immediate physical experience to a two-dimensional recording in time -->

> « These pieces begin with listening-through-recording, in which I sit with a portable recording device for 5-10 minutes in a location that seems well suited to a kind of silence, and I try to listen to everything that I imagine the microphone can hear. At a later point, I return to each of these recordings and compose a piece around them, but leaving each original location recording largely unedited. These pieces exist almost as fragrance, passing clouds of colouration suspended in air. »
