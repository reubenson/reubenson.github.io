_**[Airports for Music]({{ url }})**_ is an ongoing collection of compositions that juxtapose location recordings with synthetic sound, produced under the metaphor of sound as a fragrance drifting gently from speakers into the air.

These pieces begin with listening-through-recording, in which I sit with a portable recording device for 5-10 minutes in a location that seems well suited to a kind of silence, and I try to listen to everything that I imagine the microphone can hear. At a later point, I return to each of these recordings and compose a piece around them, but leaving each original location recording largely unedited. These pieces exist almost as fragrance, passing clouds of colouration suspended in air.

Works in this collection have been serially published to [Nina Protocol](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/) as an experiment with self-publishing alternatives to the existing major streaming platforms. In particular, this project benefits from being able to associate the music with a primary body of text, and can easily include works by other interested contributors.

<!-- Similar to distilling a fragrance, I think of this project as exploration  -->

<!-- There's an inherent _lossiness_ to making location recordings, which reduce all the sensory dimensions of immediate physical experience to a two-dimensional recording in time -->
