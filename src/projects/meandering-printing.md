_Ceramic Meandering_ was made with 3D-printed porcelain, using the specific means of this technology to frame the evolution of the line in arts and architecture. Taking advantage of the fact that 3D-printing can make a single continuous line of clay, I used the Greek meander motif to transform the ornamental line into an architectural form.

Over the course of a two-week workshop at The Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, I designed, fabricated, and activated various ceramics sculptures. In this work, I focused on site-specificity and expression of the line, and [wrote a brief essay about my process](https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd).

As the centerpiece piece in my final show, I assembled a mixed-media sculpture that included porcelain (both bisque and greenware), wood boards, a rock, a piece of seaweed, a barnacle shell, and a stencil-print made of porcelain dust. The resulting sculpture plays with the idea of a print (in its different contexts) and gestures at notions of land art (Robert Smithsonâ€™s Spiral Jetty, porcelain as earthen material), which came full circle when I brought the brittle, un-fired ceramic sculpture (what we call greenware) to dissolve into the ocean the hour before finally departing from campus.

<!-- As I continued to work with/against/through these printers, I came back around to the core, unresolvable question of what exactly these machines were freeing up our hands to do, aside from signing the work, or a bit of touch-up. While I did find myself missing the tactile feedback of building up forms by hand, I did also find myself being less precious about each printed object, that while each object had been de-virtualized as a result of the printing process, its physical existence seemed somehow still tenuous, and in flux. -->

<!-- In the summer of 2023, I attended a workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at the [Haystack Mountain School of Crafts](https://www.haystack-mtn.org/). You can read reflections on that workshop [here](https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd), see an image gallery of selected works [here](/ceramics), and check out ceramics for sale on <a href="https://sonceramics.etsy.com">Etsy</a>.
