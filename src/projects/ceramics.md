My work with clay began in 2019, though it was a medium I had been thinking about for a long time beforehand. I think of my ceramics pratice as an extension of my work with sound, in which I had increasingly focused on aspects of form, surface, and color. Looking back, <a href="https://reubenson.com/weaving">Weaving Music</a> project is perhaps the clearest bridge from my sound-based work to ceramics.

<!-- In the summer of 2023, I attended a workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at the [Haystack Mountain School of Crafts](https://www.haystack-mtn.org/). You can read reflections on that workshop [here](https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd). -->
