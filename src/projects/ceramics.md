<!-- Ceramics, for me, privilege doing over thinking, feeling over knowing,  -->

In ceramics, I mostly work with intuitive forms, striations of color built up into surface. It seems to have grown out of my sound art practice, which has increasingly become focused on notions of materiality.

<!-- I think of my ceramics pratice as an extension of my work with sound, in which I had increasingly focused on aspects of form, surface, and color. Looking back, <a href="https://reubenson.com/weaving">Weaving Music</a> project is perhaps the clearest bridge from my sound-based work to ceramics. -->
