Audio-visual software built for artist/publisher James Hoff, using realtime audio analysis to programmatically détourn Google Maps Street View into audio-reactive cinematography reminiscent of Michael Snow's [*La Région Centrale*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYr_SvIKKuI). 

This project debuted at the [London ICA in 2016](https://archive.ica.art/whats-on/ica-associates-pan-present-james-hoff-lee-gamble-steve-warwick-nora-khan-tcf/index.html), and has been presented internationally at galleries and music festivals alike. A notable iteration of this project was published on [PAN records](https://p-a-n.org/releases/) in 2019 as a standalone video, which was produced without any edits.
