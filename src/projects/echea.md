_Echea_ is a mixed media sculpture produced in collaboration with the artist and composer Eli Keszler for an eponymous exhibition at Galerie Pepe (Mexico City). Four large earthenware vessels provide _interiors_ arranged with ceramic tongues and an audio playback system. These tongues gesture towards both sound and silence, a sussuration of voices and echoes sputtering out to the velvet-lined walls of the gallery; sound is a body searching for its surface.

<!-- The sculpture consists of four large earthenware vessels containing ceramic tongues, speakers, and a repeating hour-long audio programme. -->

<!-- The vessels were produced by an artisan in Guadalajara, and their _interiors_ were activated with -->
