_Echea_ is a mixed media sculpture produced with the artist and composer Eli Keszler for an exhibition at Galerie Pepe (Mexico City). The sculpture consists of four large earthenware vessels containing ceramic tongues, speakers, and audio programme, in which I produced the tongues and collaborated on all the other aspects of the sculpture.

I've collaborated with the artist and composer Eli Keszler over many years, with roles ranging from ranging from [bassoon performance on _Cold Pin_](https://p-a-n.org/product/eli-keszler-cold-pin-pan-21/) (2011), Arduino microcontroller programming for an installation at the [MIT List Center](https://listart.mit.edu/exhibitions/open-tunings) (2015), [sound design and live spatialization for a performance at The Whitney](https://whitney.org/events/eli-keszler) (2019), and most recently, a [mixed media sculpture at Galerie Pepe](https://arc.net/l/quote/qgchhwmo) titled _Echea_ (2024).

<!-- which creates an intimacy of experience that can be difficult with larger sculpture that interacts on the scale of architecture or environment. -->
