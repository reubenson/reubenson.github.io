And now I find that writing has become a necessary component of my practice, in which I uncover the poetic affinities between the things that fascinate me. The writing process itself inspires a certain mode of research and reading, which then in turn inspires a desire to not just make objects that may speak for themselves, but to say something about the world in which such things can even exist.
