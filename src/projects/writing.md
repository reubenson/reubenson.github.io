Excerpt from "Surface Tension" (2024)
{.project-grid-item-full}

The writing process itself inspires a certain mode of research and reading, which then in turn inspires a desire to not just make objects that may speak for themselves, but to say something about the world in which such things can even exist.

<!-- Looking back, my <a href="https://reubenson.com/weaving">Weaving Music</a> project is perhaps the clearest bridge from my sound-based work to ceramics. -->
