<!-- In the summer of 2023, I attended a workshop on 3D-printing ceramics at the [Haystack Mountain School of Crafts](https://www.haystack-mtn.org/). You can read reflections on that workshop [here](https://medium.com/@reubenson/foray-into-3d-printing-with-clay-at-haystack-207064511cd), see an image gallery of selected works [here](/ceramics), and check out ceramics for sale on <a href="https://sonceramics.etsy.com">Etsy</a>.
