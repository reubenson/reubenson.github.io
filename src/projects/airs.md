description: Poems accompanied by recordings of the wind
year: 2025

[Airs](https://thehtml.review/04/airs) was published the Spring 2025 issue of [The HTML Review](https://thehtml.review), and began as a series of audio recordings made in quiet, open spaces. It combines typographic distortions and animation with a generative audio environment around the theme of air. The work facilitates multiple modes of attention, between the atmospheric and the concrete.

<!-- These recordings were made in wide, open spaces, and expressed an ambiguous desire for a kind of _airiness_. During this period of my life, I contented myself with the metaphor that, as if after a long winter, I was going around and opening every window I could find. -->

<!-- In the summer of 2023, I began to incorporate these recordings into composed pieces, which I titled "[Airports for Music](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/hubs/airportsformusic)". Audio convolution techniques guided the construction of this music, folding the texture of space into sound. In alluding to these pieces as "sound fragrances", I wanted to distinguish them from broader practices of ambient music and field recording, and instead associate them with the artifice and materiality of **perfume**. -->

"Part I (The Page)" explores the poetics of air through its interaction with language, and flattened onto the surface of the webpage. An image from Wikipedia's [article on the Santa Ana winds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Ana_winds) was used as a visual artifact to distort the text, a gesture towards the way in which language is contoured by environmental forces, and a memorial to the Eaton Canyon fire in January 2025 that raged through neighborhoods I grew up around.

In "Part II (The Screen)" of **Airs**, a concrete poem representing a **screen** slowly dissolves into something like a screen-saver. The soft music accompanying this is activated by the sound of the wind, like an aeolian harp. The processed sound itself drives the animation, in which audio samples are translated into pixel data that changes in real-time with the underlying audio.

The sound for **Airs** came out of my earlier music project [Airports for Music](https://www.ninaprotocol.com/hubs/airportsformusic), in which audio convolution techniques are used to produce what I called _sound fragrances_, in order to distinguish them from broader practices of ambient music and field recording, and instead associate them with the artifice and materiality of perfume.
