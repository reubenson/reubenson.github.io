Along the Ljubljanica River at Lubljiana's Museum of Architecture and Design, I gave a talk on background music and the web. This talk was organized as part of the [Naive Yearly](https://naiveyearly.com/) conference, featuring other talks by [Nathalie Lawhead](http://www.nathalielawhead.com/), [Kim Kleinert](https://kim-kleinert.digitale-grafik.com/), [Agnes Cameron](https://agnescameron.info/), [Daniel Murray](https://loom.cafe/), [Charmaine Li](https://charmaineli.ca/), [Koloyan Kolev](https://kaloyankolev.com/), and [Tiger Dingsun](https://www.tiger.exposed/).

An essay, titled _Quiet Time_, based on the talk has been published by [Are.na Editorial](https://www.are.na/editorial/quiet-time), which surveys the industrial history of background music and raises questions about ambient music as a commodity in the ecosystem of streaming platforms while looking to phenomenology around our disparate modes of attention (focused and environmental) towards a more humanistic framing of our sonic experiences amongst the monoliths of techno-culture.

The talk concluded with a performance of a _group listening performance_ piece titled "River Song". audience members were directed to a webpage that randomly assigned each of their phones a single note to play from a larger harmonic chord structure. These notes slowly diminished in volume until reaching silence while audience members roamed along the Ljubljanica River.

I intended this improvised choreography of shifting sound and bodies to produce a kind of sonic sculpture that slowly brought the environment into awareness. To “frame noise, present it, articulate the way its sounding reveals also an intimate structure, a micro-surface of folds, and the continuation of these folds into our bodies,” as the writer Lisa Robertson puts it.
