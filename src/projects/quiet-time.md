Along the Ljubljanica River, I gave a talk on acousmatic sound and the web. This talk was organized as part of the [Naive Yearly](https://naiveyearly.com/) conference, featuring other talks by [Nathalie Lawhead](http://www.nathalielawhead.com/), [Kim Kleinert](https://kim-kleinert.digitale-grafik.com/), [Agnes Cameron](https://agnescameron.info/), [Daniel Murray](https://loom.cafe/), [Charmaine Li](https://charmaineli.ca/), [Koloyan Kolev](https://kaloyankolev.com/), and [Tiger Dingsun](https://www.tiger.exposed/). An essay version of the talk will be published soon by [Are.na Editorial](https://www.are.na/editorial).

The talk concluded with a performance of a _group listening performance_ piece titled "River Song".
