_After Orpheus_ is a mixed media sound sculpture. It combines steel piano wire with a bell-shaped ceramic vessel that serves to amplify the resonance of steel piano wire.

The vessel sits atop a small stack of bricks, which weigh down and conceal an anchoring base plate that holds tension across the piano wire. The sculpture takes inspiration from the long tradition of aeolian instruments activated by the wind and the myth of Orpheus's lyre, said to have moved stones. Although this sculpture could be paced outdoors to the wind, here the indoor installation relies instead on electromagnetic activation (via e-bow).

This sculpture is the first iteration of what I envision as a template for further experimentation, in which the latent acoustics of ceramic vessels are activated through various means.

A pile of bricks, a ceramic bell, and a c-stand frame the physical tension of a long steel wire that quietly sings. With a cup held up against the wire, you can almost hear a willing of stones to dance once more, the ghost of the lyre of Orpheus.
