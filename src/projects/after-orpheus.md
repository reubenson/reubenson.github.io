_After Orpheus_ is a mixed media sculpture that combines steel piano wire with ceramics and electronics to produce acoustically amplified sound without speakers. Visitors may additionally interact with the sculpture by holding their ear against a paper cup placed along the vibrating wire.

This sculpture is part of a body of work (in progress) in which ceramic vessels are activated through a variety of physical means. Although this sculpture could be also placed outdoors and activated by the wind, here the indoor installation relies instead on electromagnetic activation (via e-bow).
\
\
The sculpture takes inspiration from the long tradition of aeolian instruments activated by the wind and the myth of Orpheus's lyre, said to have moved stones.

<!-- A pile of bricks, a ceramic bell, and a c-stand frame the physical tension of a long steel wire that quietly sings. With a cup held up against the wire, you can almost hear a willing of stones to dance once more, the ghost of the lyre of Orpheus. -->
