**[Weaving Music](/weaving)** is an exploration of the materiality of sound through the metaphor of weaving, the loom re-imagined as a music sequencer.

I began developing this project in the summer of 2019, at a <a href="https://elektronmusikstudion.se/composers/2019/1013-reuben-son-ems-10-19-june-2019">studio residency at EMS</a> in Stockholm, where I used MIDI signals generated by this app to control voicings produced on their Buchla and Serge synthesizer systems.

In the end, this project attempts a fairly straightforward translation of weaving notation to music notation, in that patterns are read from left to right as columns along the warp (vertical threads hung on a a weaving loom). In the current version, there are two ways of interpreting how a column should be handled: as octaves (in octave mode) or as a canon (in canon mode).

These various modes offer different expressions of the underlying harmonic structure of the chord selected to go with the weaving pattern. <br/><br/> In sharing this software, my hope is that you too may find it useful for harmonic and rhythmic research and discovery, sharing some similarity in intent to the historical [Triadex Muse](https://till.com/articles/muse/).
