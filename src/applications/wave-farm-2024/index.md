<!-- During a 10-day residency at Wave Farm, artists develop new transmission artworks, informed by access to a research library, equipment, unique workspace resources, and on-site staff support.

In 2024, the Wave Farm Residency Program will emphasize “Live Performance for an Expanded Studio Audience.” Each residency will conclude with a public event at Wave Farm, which is also a live radio broadcast on Wave Farm Radio: WGXC 90.7-FM Radio for Open Ears in NY’s Upper Hudson Valley. -->

### Artist Statement
Please describe your current artistic practice in one or two succinct paragraphs.

### Project Title
Provide the title of the transmission artwork you are proposing to work on during your Wave Farm residency.

### Project Description
<!-- Describe the project you are proposing to work on during a Wave Farm Residency. -->
- Extend FrogChorus to work with commercial low-range radio transmitters and receivers, and new custom software … radio cybernetics made audible
- Ceramics have been used historically as resonator in early radio circuits, before quartz crystals — this could be extended to create resonators vessels for the radio objects, for translating the electromagnetic to acoustic


### Live Performance for an Expanded Studio Audience Description
- Develop webapp that allows visitors to interact with the sound sculpture in some way?
<!-- Describe the live radio broadcast and culminating public event for your residency. -->

### Technical Support Needs
Please outline what technical support, if any, you will require in order to create your proposed project.
### Work Samples/Supporting Materials
Submit at least one URL linking to at least one, and no more than three examples of past works relevant to your proposal.

- 12/2023 | Complete functional working prototype
- 01/2024 | Iterate on UI/UX (input from Olia L will be highly valuable and desirable)
- 02/2024 | Begin field-testing and QA, and draft essay (to contextualize the aims of the project)
- 03/2024 | Conclude functional and accessibility testing, address issues and bugs, and finish essay writing
- 03/21/2024 | Final code deployment and code freeze, no further deployments unless critical bugs have been found
- 04/2024 | Official launch! (Optional: would love to use part of the funding to pay for travel to Holland, to lead listening workshops) -->
