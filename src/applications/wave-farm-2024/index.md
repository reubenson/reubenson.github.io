During a 10-day residency at Wave Farm, artists develop new transmission artworks, informed by access to a research library, equipment, unique workspace resources, and on-site staff support.

In 2024, the Wave Farm Residency Program will emphasize “Live Performance for an Expanded Studio Audience.” Each residency will conclude with a public event at Wave Farm, which is also a live radio broadcast on Wave Farm Radio: WGXC 90.7-FM Radio for Open Ears in NY’s Upper Hudson Valley.

### Artist Statement
<!-- Please describe your current artistic practice in one or two succinct paragraphs. -->
Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York City) is a Korean-American artist and technologist who makes sound, software, and ceramics. For more than a decade, his sound-based work has engaged the materiality of sound, as magnetic tape or through metaphors of woven textile and fragrance. In his most recent work, like _[Airports For Music](/projects/airports-for-music)_ (2023) and _[Frog Chorus](/projects/frog-chorus)_ (2023), he has focused on his practice around air as a critical medium for sound, what we give it (attention), and what it can carry (intention).

<!-- Reuben Son (born 1986, lives in New York) is an interdisciplinary technologist who makes software, sound, and ceramics. Across these different media, he approaches his work as sculpture, as an engagement with some form of materiality that is ultimately rooted in embodied experience.

As a full-stack software developer, he has worked primarily at media companies (Vox and New York Magazine) building out the sites like The Strategist, but began his programming career within institutions of academic research science. He considers sound art to be his primary creative practice, and has mostly been working in a supporting/collaborative role with artists like Eli Keszler and James Hoff for institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art and the London ICA. Since 2019, his interest in surface and form has also led to ceramics, which he likes to think of as sound made out of clay.

He is currently taking a "gap year" while surveying the current techno-social landscape and searching for the appropriate containers for his upcoming professional and creative projects. -->

### Project Title
<!-- Provide the title of the transmission artwork you are proposing to work on during your Wave Farm residency. -->
"_All Water Understands_"

### Project Description
<!-- Describe the project you are proposing to work on during a Wave Farm Residency. -->
I would like to propose a project that considers waves across different media, in continuation of my recent body of work focused on air as a medium. In [Frog Chorus](/projects/frog-chorus), ephemeral sound sculptuture emerges out of the acoustic interactions between devices, each acting as a transmitter and a receiver within a structure that dynamically interacts with itself and the enveloping environment. In my project for Wave Farm, I'd like to explore ways in which the _directedness_ of interactions in a transmitter-receiver model breaks down as the system becomes more complex, as agents become environment.
<!-- While much of my previous work deals directly with acoustic vibrations in air, the project I am proposing considers waves more broadly.  -->



<!-- The notion of transmission presumes a transmitter and a receiver, and the necessity of some sort of threshold in between. This project considers what happens as that threshold goes to zero, when transmitter and receiver are packed close together, like a body of water. -->

<!-- Transmission implies a transmitter and a receiver, and a medium in between. -->

<!-- My approach to location recordings is to act as a receiver, without a clearly defined transmitter -->

During the residency, I would like to use the hydrophone to record underwater sounds from various bodies of water around Wave Farm, and compose these recordings into a set of modular compositions. As I record these sounds, I would act as a receiver for dense aquatic environments, irreducible to a set of well-defined transmitters. The resulting compositions would then be split up and played synchronously through multiple FM transmitters, each of which would be roughly equidistant to a central FM receiver, positioned such that the signal from each of the transmitters is mixed dynamically based on slight variations in signal strength, and the FM receiver's ability to lock onto a given source. The sonic result of this experimental style of mixing is difficult to anticipate, so part of the residency would be dedicated to tuning this behavior, and adjusting my approach as needed. In more poetic terms, my aim is to turn the sounds of the water into an evocation of swirling weather.

I would consider these works to be part of my [Airports for Music](/projects/airports-for-music) series, which always begin with an intentional act of focused listening while holding the microphone. This proposal has also been inspired in part by a poem titled _[The Social Life of Water](https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/405/the-social-life-of-water)_ by Tony Hoagland, and this text may get incorporated into either the hydrophone-based compositions, or the final performance.



<!-- - Utilize short-distance FM transmitters to beam to a stereo pair of FM receivers. The FM transmitters may interfere with each other, competing for broadcast -->
<!-- - Social life of water … but with em waves all around us … transmission presumes there is a transmitter and a receiver, a threshold between, but what if that threshold is diffuse and expansive, like the weather, not really a threshold at all? Instead of transmission, we sit at the threshold as if on the shore of a great ocean or lake. In the performance, the poem will be read multiple times, transmitted also, though it may not make it through to the receiver -->


### Live Performance for an Expanded Studio Audience Description
<!-- Describe the live radio broadcast and culminating public event for your residency. -->
In the live performance, compositions made using hydrophone recordings will be mixed live for the in-person and radio audience. The performance will have a sculptural quality, in that the compostions will be transmitted via multiple FM transmitters, with a single FM receiver responsible for mixing the various sources and relaying the mixed signal to the P.A. system and radio broadcast. Once set up, the installation will be self-evolving, but as part of the performance, I will physically manipulate the FM receiver in order to modulate the live mix. The live performance may also include a reading of _[The Social Life of Water](https://www.thesunmagazine.org/issues/405/the-social-life-of-water)_, which inspired this work.

### Technical Support Needs
<!-- Please outline what technical support, if any, you will require in order to create your proposed project. -->
Minimal support will be needed for this project, aside from guidance on using the hydrophone, FM transmitters, and other pieces of equipment in the Wave Farm studios.

### Work Samples/Supporting Materials

<!-- All water is a part of other water.
Cloud talks to lake; mist
speaks quietly to creek.

Lake says something back to cloud,
and cloud listens.
No water is lonely water.
 
All water is a part of other water.
River rushes to reunite with ocean;
Tree drinks rain and sweats out dew;
Dew takes elevator into cloud;
Cloud marries puddle;
                                                  puddle

has long conversation with lake about fiord;
Fog sneaks up and murmurs insinuations to swamp;
Swamp makes needs known to marshland;

Thunderstorm throws itself on estuary;
Waterspout laughs at joke of frog pond.
All water understands.

All water understands.
Reservoir gathers information
for database of watershed;
Brook translates lake to waterfall;
Tide wrinkles its green forehead and then breaks through.
All water understands.

But you, you stand on the shore
of blue Lake Kieve in the evening
and listen, grieving
as something stirs and turns within you.

Not knowing why you linger in the dark.
Not able even to guess
from what you are excluded. -->
