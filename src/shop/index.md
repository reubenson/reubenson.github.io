The shop is currently going through an update as I change things up a bit. In the meanwhile, you can use **TENOFF** to apply a $10 discount to your order :)
{.project-grid-item-full}

<!-- I've gotten in the habit of bringing a pocket-size vase with me when I travel, collecting wildflowers as I go. It's a simple gesture towards making a temporary home within dislocation, a tiny bulwark against the sometimes overwhelming feeling of _being away_. -->
<!-- {.project-grid-item-6} -->

<!-- Each vase is made on my miniature wheel at home, perched on my kitchen windowsill in fact. They range from about 1.5 to 3 inches in height, and have been produced as small experiments in form and glaze application. As such, each vase is unique and not expected to repeat within the series.

You can also check out a collection of photos from friends and family of these vessels [out in the field](/projects/travel-vase-gallery) 🌻 🏺
Please note that shipping is currently limited to the U.S.
