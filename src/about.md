When I was younger, I wanted to be a filmmaker, furniture designer, or a guitarist. While that has yet to come to pass, I still feel broadly and intensely drawn to certain kinds of experiences and objects. These days, I spend my days making software, sound, and ceramics. I also try to keep some good routines, like biking, journaling, and reading every day. Embodied cognition is increasingly important to me, as are the poetics of every-day life.

> "The aesthetic moment is a caesura in time when the subject feels held in symmetry and solitude by the spirit of the object." - Christopher Bollas, _The Shadow of the Object_

I'm still figuring things out, but I'm happy you're here and I hope you enjoy perusing some of the things I've made along the way. While none of these projects are really _finished_, I do feel like this body of work has connecting throughlines, and have given me the space to think, process, and dream of a better world.
