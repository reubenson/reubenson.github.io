As a software developer, his experience began when learning how to write code in various research science environments before working as a full-stack engineer and engineering manager at [*New York Magazine*](https://nymag.com). The bulk of his tenure there was devoted to the development of [*The Strategist*](https://nymag.com/strategist), with responsibilities spanning from implementing the full site redesign, and developing tools and services that power editorial, data, and business-development workflows in addition to the primary reader-experience across a number of distribution platforms (e.g. web, AMP, and Apple News).

He has also built out a number of projects for creative purposes. He developed custom software for the [*Hobo UFO*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERbfczLUr-A) project with artist James Hoff, which programmatically détourns Google Maps Street View into an audio-reactive cinematography reminiscent of Michael Snow's [*La Région Centrale*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYr_SvIKKuI).
