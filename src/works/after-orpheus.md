    <em>After Orpheus</em> is a mixed media sculpture that combines ceramics with chrome armature, steel piano wire and electronics to produce acoustically amplified sound without speakers. A molded paper cup held against the self-oscillating wire allows for an intimate mode of listening while also affecting the vibrational modes of the wire.

<!-- This sculpture is part of a body of work (in progress) in which ceramic vessels are activated through a variety of physical means. Although this sculpture could be also placed outdoors and activated by the wind, here the indoor installation relies instead on electromagnetic activation (via e-bow). -->
<!-- \
\
The sculpture takes inspiration from the long tradition of aeolian instruments activated by the wind and the myth of Orpheus's lyre, said to have moved stones.

<!-- A pile of bricks, a ceramic bell, and a c-stand frame the physical tension of a long steel wire that quietly sings. With a cup held up against the wire, you can almost hear a willing of stones to dance once more, the ghost of the lyre of Orpheus. -->
