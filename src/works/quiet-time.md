Along the river at Ljubljiana's Museum of Architecture and Design, I gave a talk on background music and the web. This talk was curated by [Kristoffer Tjalve](https://www.naiveweekly.com/) as part of the [Naive Yearly](https://naiveyearly.com/) conference, featuring other talks by [Nathalie Lawhead](http://www.nathalielawhead.com/), [Kim Kleinert](https://kim-kleinert.digitale-grafik.com/), [Agnes Cameron](https://agnescameron.info/), [Daniel Murray](https://loom.cafe/), [Charmaine Li](https://charmaineli.ca/), [Koloyan Kolev](https://kaloyankolev.com/), and [Tiger Dingsun](https://www.tiger.exposed/).

An essay, titled [_Quiet Time_](<(https://www.are.na/editorial/quiet-time)>), based on the talk has also been published by [Are.na Editorial](https://www.are.na/editorial). It surveys the industrial history of background music and raises questions about ambient music as a commodity within the logics of streaming platforms. It also makes the case for a more humanistic framing of the our experiences of background media through the examination of phenomenology and our disparate modes of attention (focused vs environmental).

I concluded my talk with a "group listening performance" titled _River Song_. Audience members were directed to a webpage that randomly assigned each of their phones a single note to play from a larger harmonic chord structure. These notes slowly diminished in volume until reaching silence while audience members roamed along the Ljubljanica River.

I intended this improvised choreography of shifting sound and bodies to produce a kind of sonic sculpture that slowly brought the environment into awareness. To “frame noise, present it, articulate the way its sounding reveals also an intimate structure, a micro-surface of folds, and the continuation of these folds into our bodies,” as the writer Lisa Robertson puts it.
