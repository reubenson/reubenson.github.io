[_Allure of Inertia_](<(https://www.nts.live/shows/metamorphosis-2024/episodes/metamorphosis-2024-allure-of-inertia-w-reuben-son-6th-may-2024)>) is a one-hour radio broadcast composed for NTS, a community radio station based in London. This mix was produced on the theme of _metamorphosis_.

"Music for holding the capacity to change, for letting go of state. Breaking forms and surfaces, following water to weather. Speakers diffusing fragrances of sound. From open windows and sliding glass doors to the ocean … _amor fati_."

This program was mixed and edited specifically for radio, presenting a survey of works by composers who deal with the phenomenology of listening directly in their compositional practices.
{.project-grid-item-2}

At one extreme, Jakob Ullmann and Luc Ferrari explore composition at the threshold of being reduced to almost nothing. In his liner notes, Ullmann often suggests to "set the volume so as to just barely mask the ambient sounds in the room".

Along a different paradigm, Jana Winderen and Felix Hess use non-traditional recording methods to work with sound beyond the natural limits of human hearing, and Yukio Fujimoto uses sculptural devices to augment his own hearing.
