Stoneware ceramic drum with apertures on the side and the top. The instrument is based on the traditional Nigerian udu, but made with the Korean moon jar technique. Its egg-shaped form pays homage to Assagioli's model of _psychosynthesis_, while also functioning ergonomically to to sit comfortably on the lap.

    <em>After Orpheus</em> is a mixed media sculpture that combines ceramics with chrome armature, steel piano wire and electronics to produce acoustically amplified sound without speakers. A molded paper cup held against the self-oscillating wire allows for an intimate mode of listening while also affecting the vibrational modes of the wire.
