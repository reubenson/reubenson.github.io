Pier 6 Liberty Lawn, Brooklyn Bridge Park

Come join for a picnic marking ten years of living in NYC (also happens to be labor day). No particular agenda, bring who you like and perhaps a picnic blanket and a snack. The weather's been good for kites lately, and I'll bring a few :)

Warmly,
\
Reuben
