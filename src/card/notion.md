Hi there! 

I'm a software engineer and creative technologist who is interested in the [Core Product engineering role at Notion](https://boards.greenhouse.io/notion/jobs/4973980003). I've spent much of my career working on a modular and component system for a CMS, and rather curious about Notion's block data model!

I'm currently transitioning out of a sabbatical, during which I've developed a range of experimental web-based projects and am currently writing a couple essays for the knowledge-sharing platform [Are.na](https://are.na).

If you're open to it, I would love to chat about your work at Notion and whether you might be able to help get my resume in front of the appropriate hiring manager!
