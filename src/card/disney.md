Hi there! 

I'm a software engineer who is interested in the [Senior Engineer role on the Commerce, Growth, and Identity team at Disney](https://jobs.disneycareers.com/job/santa-monica/sr-software-engineer/391/62890963600). I've previously worked as a tech lead and engineering manager at _New York Magazine_ and _Vox Media_, where I architected and launched an internal ecommerce platform serving sites like [The Strategist](https://nymag.com/strategist) and helped get _New York Magazine_'s digital subscriptions service off the ground. In my next role, I'm interested in switching back to an individual contributor on a services team, focused on the design and scaling up of systems that serve a wide range of verticals.

I'm currently transitioning out of a sabbatical, during which I've developed a range of experimental web-based projects and am currently writing a couple essays for the knowledge-sharing platform [Are.na](https://are.na).

If you're open to it, I would love to chat about your work at Disney and whether you might be able to help get my resume in front of the appropriate hiring manager!
