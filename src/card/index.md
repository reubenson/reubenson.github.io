<!-- I'm a software engineer and creative technologist who is interested in the [EM role at Alma](https://boards.greenhouse.io/alma/jobs/7331504002). I've spent much of my career building out product alternatives to traditional advertising revenue for media companies, and am interested in putting my product development experience further towards services that truly serve their users. -->

<!-- I'm currently transitioning out of a sabbatical, during which I've realigned myself around what I still find compelling about building software for the web. And as someone who has been in therapy since 2018, I can really relate to the challenges of accessing mental health services and navigating the complex web of compliance regulations around insurer-paid services. -->

<!-- If you're open to it, I would love to get your thoughts on the business of mental health and your experience at Alma! -->
