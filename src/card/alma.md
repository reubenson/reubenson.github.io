Hi there! 

I'm a software engineer and creative technologist who is interested in the [EM role at Alma](https://boards.greenhouse.io/alma/jobs/7331504002). I've spent much of my career building out product alternatives to traditional advertising revenue for media companies, and am interested in putting my product development experience further towards services that truly serve their users.

I'm currently transitioning out of a sabbatical, during which I've developed a range of experimental web-based projects and am currently writing a couple essays for the knowledge-sharing platform [Are.na](https://are.na).. And as someone who has been in therapy since 2018, I can really relate to the challenges of accessing mental health services and navigating the complex web of compliance regulations around insurer-paid services.

If you're open to it, I would love to chat about your work at Alma and whether you might be able to help get my resume in front of the appropriate hiring manager!
