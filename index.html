            Formerly an engineer at <a href="https://nymag.com" target="_blank">New York Magazine</a>, he is currently on professional sabbatical, but open to short-term creative projects and collaborations.

        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
          As a software developer, his experience began when learning how to write code in various research science environments before working as a full-stack engineer and engineering manager at New York Magazine. The bulk of his tenure there was devoted to The Strategist, with responsibilities spanning from implementing the full site redesign, and developing tools and services that power workflows for editorial and business-development stakeholders, as well as powering the reader-experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          He has also built out a number of projects for creative purposes. He built custom audio-visual software for the artist James Hoff, which re-purposes Google Maps Street View as a tool for audio-responsive articulation of a locality. In Frog Chorus, he translates an older work of sound art by Felix Hess into a web-app that remains faithful to the original project while examining our general cultural anxiety around smartphones and the advent of machine learning.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="sound">
        <h2>Sound</h2>
        <p>
          As a sound artist, he explores the notion of composition as the deployment of strategies for dealing with the propositional materiality of sound. Drawing from the origins of computing within the history of textile production, his current body of work attempts to formalize this idea of sonic materiality by abstracting principles of weaving and textile design into a generative framework for electronic music production.

            <h3>HOBO UFO (with <a href="http://www.callicoonfinearts.com/artists/james-hoff/">James Hoff</a>)</h3>
            <p>
              Custom standalone application for the <em class="collaboration-project-name">Hobo UFO</em>, in which navigation and camera movement in <em>Google Maps Street View</em> responds to live audio and MIDI control in real-time. <em>Hobo UFO</em> was premiered at the <em>London ICA</em> in 2016, and presented at various other venues and festivals between 2016 and 2019. Most recently, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERbfczLUr-A" target="_blank">video edition</a> was produced for <a href="https://p-a-n.org/release/james-hoff-hobo-ufo-v-chernobyl/" target="_blank">PAN</a>.

              <p>
                The QCVG (Quad Control Voltage Generator) is a hardware and software package designed and developed for computerized control of an analogue modular synthesizer.
              </p> 
              <p>
                The QCVG is comprised of an Arduino Nano microcontroller interfaced to a pair of dual 12-bit DAC chips (MCP4822), which provide four channels of 0-4V CV (control voltage) for controlling oscillator pitch, and four trigger outputs (for triggering envelope generators in the synthesizer).
              </p>
              <p>    
                The <a href="https://github.com/reubenson/qcvg">software is written in C++</a>, and an example of music recorded with the QCVG can be heard on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/reubenson/qcvg-demo-sketch">SoundCloud</a>.
              </p>

            <h3>Private Chronology</h3>
            <p>
              Private Chronology was a micro-label operating between 2009 and 2015, with 10 editions
            published in cassette, vinyl, and digital formats.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="/private-chronology/10">Still Sleeping</a> is the final release on Private Chronology, and consists of electronic music made with a Eurorack modular synthesizer. Although much of the sound design was executed using traditional analogue techniques, control signals were generated digitally using simple algorithms programmed on the <a href="/private-chronology/qcvg">QCVG</a>.
